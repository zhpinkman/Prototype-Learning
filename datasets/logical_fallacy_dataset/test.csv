" Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to intelligent design is a prime example.  Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic argument from ignorance), and an area where we very well may have a scientific answer in the next decade, at which time, the “origin of life” argument will fade away and be replaced by another, thus moving the figurative goalposts farther back as our understanding of the natural world increases.Exception: This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.  The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the moving the goalposts fallacy, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (“has to be”, “must”, “required for”, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be ad hoc objections that follow eventually leading to an impossible request for proof.
Fun Fact: The name “moving the goalposts” comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

There is strong movement from people who choose not to consume meat, and their reasons vary from the healthiness to the effort of making the body looks appropriate or ideal. This is a rather ludicrous idea.
Human beings have been consuming meat since thousands of years and counting. There are no cases when consuming meat causing severe problems, provided meat is consumed in appropriate amount, for everyone. Many say that being a vegan means having a healthier, stronger body and mind. Actualy, according to studies, our bodies are perfectly capable of digesting, absorbing and making full use of the many beneficial nutrients found in animal foods. Thus, there is no health reason to completely avoid animal foods.
Don’t put unnecessary restrain on yourselves. You should enjoy life to the fullest; give your best in any possible situations, as well as consuming meat.

"Concentrations of this gas are slightly less than 420 parts-per-million ( ppm ) , or one-sixth the average historic levels of 2,600 ppm for the last 600 million years .",1
The science and data strongly support that our planet ’ s ecosystems are thriving and that humanity is benefiting from modestly increasing temperature and an increase in carbon dioxide .,1
These facts refute the claim that Earth is spiraling into one man-made climate catastrophe after another .,12
"All the while droughts , forest fires , heat waves , and temperature-related deaths have declined substantially .",6
"What changes the future holds are hardly certain , but judging from the past , they too will be small .",8
"If you get your news only from mainstream media , you would likely believe that CO2 levels are dangerously high and unprecedented .",8
"Concentrations of this gas are slightly less than 420 parts-per-million ( ppm ) , or one-sixth the average historic levels of 2,600 ppm for the last 600 million years .",8
"During the last glacial period , concentrations nearly reached the “ line of death ” at 150 parts per million , below which plants die .",4
"However , records indicate that modern warming began more than 300 years ago in the depths of the horrific Little Ice Age .",11
Context is important when reviewing climate and temperature data .,8
Global warming saves lives .,2
"Viewed in the long-term geologic context , we are actually CO2 impoverished .",8
"Longer-term data reveal multiple warming periods since the end of the last major ice age 10,000 years ago , each warmer than today .",8
"There is a strong correlation between the rise and fall of temperature and the ebb and flow of civilizations . During the last three warm periods dating back 6,000 years to the advent of the first great civilizations , humanity prospered and great empires arose . Intervening cold periods brought crop failure , famine , and mass depopulation .",5
History advises us to welcome warmth and fear cold .,8
"Contrary to sensational media reports , extreme weather-related deaths in the U.S. have decreased more than 98 % over the last 100 years .",7
"Twenty times as many people die from cold as from heat , according to a worldwide review of 74 million temperature-related deaths by Dr. Antonio Gasparrini and a team of physicians . Global warming saves lives .",5
"Ultimately , politicians will face a difficult choice : persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong .",3
"We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century , then the changes we would experience would be manageable .",2
"We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century , then the changes we would experience would be manageable .",4
The countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated .,4
It 's no coincidence that this storm exploded in an area of near-record warm sea surface temperatures that had not yet been tapped by any other recent storms .,7
"Computer models of the climate are at the heart of calls to ban the cheap , reliable energy that powers our thriving economy and promotes healthier , longer lives .",4
"For decades , these models have projected dramatic warming from small , fossil-fueled increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide , with catastrophic consequences .",4
Should we trust these computer models of doom ?,9
"In the upper levels of the lower atmosphere , the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed .",6
"Why didn ’ t he simply look down here , where we all live ?",5
"In this revision , temperatures were estimated from nearby land stations . This runs afoul of basic physics .",1
"But each serial adjustment has tended to make the early years colder , which increases the warming trend . That ’ s wildly improbable .",3
"Even in warm summers , there ’ s plenty of ice over much of the Arctic Ocean .",1
"According to the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events , and the ongoing rise in sea level that began with the end of the ice age continues with no great increase in magnitude .",8
"NASA honored him for this achievement , and he was an author for a previous edition of the U.N. report . He told a House Science Committee hearing in March 2017 that the U.N. climate models have failed badly . Christy compared the average model projections since 1979 to the most reliable observations — those made by satellites and weather balloons over the vast tropics .",8
"Shelters in poorer countries are not repainted as often , and darker stations absorb more of the sun ’ s energy . It ’ s no surprise that poor tropical countries show the largest warming from this effect .",6
"As long as the ice-water mix is well-stirred ( like a glass of ice water ) , the surface temperature stays at the freezing point until all the ice melts .",2
"Shelters in poorer countries are not repainted as often , and darker stations absorb more of the sun ’ s energy . It ’ s no surprise that poor tropical countries show the largest warming from this effect .",7
And then you get scared .,4
"At six feet , though , around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced , and the world ’ s most vulnerable megacities , like Shanghai , Mumbai , and Ho Chi Minh City , could be wiped off the map .",4
"The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica . ( A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “ The Doomsday Glacier. ” ) Together , they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world ’ s oceans — an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet .",4
"Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs can ’ t support their own weight . Once they start to crumble , the destruction would be unstoppable .",4
"Minute-by-minute , huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea , as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building .",0
All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years — much too quickly for humanity to adapt .,4
"South Florida would be largely uninhabitable ; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey , as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings .",1
That ’ s a decision worth countless trillions of dollars and millions of lives .,4
"Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long , these glaciers , named Pine Island and Thwaites , have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea , part of the vast Southern Ocean .",4
"Minute-by-minute , huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea , as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building . The result : a global catastrophe the likes of which we ’ ve never seen .",4
"Unfortunately , it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios .",4
"Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude , but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode .",11
"“ It could happen faster or slower , I don ’ t think we really know yet , ” says Jeremy Bassis , a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan . “ But it ’ s within the realm of possibility , and that ’ s kind of a scary thing . ”",1
What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse .,3

"In fact , it seems that the less the climate
changes , the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get .",7
"But the cry
of “ global warming ” has grown ever more shrill .",9
"The following are
such points of agreement :
1 ) The climate is always changing .",1
"2 ) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible , but adding it to the
atmosphere should lead to some warming .",5
"4 ) Over this period ( the past two centuries ) , the global mean temperature has increased
slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius ; but only since
the 1960 ’ s have man ’ s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role .",8

"So why are so many people worried , indeed , panic stricken about
this issue .",4
"Global warming alarmism provides them , more than any other issue , with the things they
most want : For politicians it ’ s money and power . For environmentalists it ’ s money for their
organizations and confirmation of their near religious devotion to the idea that man is a
destructive force acting upon nature . And for the media it ’ s ideology , money , and headlines .",12
"Meanwhile , over the last decade , scientists outside of climate physics have jumped on the
bandwagon , publishing papers blaming global warming for everything from acne to the Syrian
civil war .",6
"And crony capitalists have eagerly grabbed for the subsidies that governments have
so lavishly provided .",9
"AD
Long was not involved in the current work , but his research had previously demonstrated that ocean oxygen loss was expected to occur and that it should soon be possible to demonstrate that in the real world through measurements , despite the complexities involved in studying the global ocean and deducing trends about it .",8
