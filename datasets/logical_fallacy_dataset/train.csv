But the same coastline that draws locals to its scenic vistas is threatening to slowly engulf the historic city as sea levels rise due to global warming .,4
"Image modelling shows that swaths of Osaka – the commercial heart of a region whose GDP is almost as big as that of the Netherlands – would disappear beneath the water in a 3C world , threatening the local economy and almost a third of the wider region ’ s 19 million residents .",0

"A rapid disintegration of Antarctica might , in the worst case , cause the sea to rise so fast that tens of millions of coastal refugees would have to flee inland , potentially straining societies to the breaking point .",0
"Because the collapse of vulnerable parts of the ice sheet could raise the sea level dramatically , the continued existence of the world ’ s great coastal cities — Miami , New York , Shanghai and many more — is tied to Antarctica ’ s fate .",4

"As I recently reported at Forbes.com , a study presented last month at the American Geophysical Union found that well-sited and well-maintained stations report significantly less warming than the surface station network as a whole . Government overseers collect the raw temperature data from the full network of surface stations and then produce temperature summaries for public distribution .",8

"Hurricanes , tornadoes , floods , droughts and other natural disasters have yet to show any obvious long-term change .",6
"This means that in order for politicians to advance policy goals ( such as forcing expensive solar energy on the masses or creating a carbon tax ) , they have to turn normal weather disasters into “ evidence ” of climate change .",6
"Furthermore , the overall increases in such things as hurricanes and tornadoes have not materialized . Drought in the western U.S. pales in comparison to the mega-droughts tree rings tell us existed in centuries past . Lake-bottom sediments in Florida tell us that recent major hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico has been less frequent than in centuries past .

"The study also found that the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts , leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels , making it difficult to prepare for the effects .",1
"As global warming pushes temperatures up , more people will die in heat waves ; a point emphasized by campaigners like UN climate chief , Christiana Figueres . What we don ’ t hear from her is that fewer people will die from cold .",5
"As the world develops , it has become much less vulnerable : a hurricane hitting Florida kills few people while a similar event in Guatemala kills tens of thousands .",0
"A recent Nature study expecting more severe hurricanes from global warming still found that damages would halve from 0.04 per cent to 0.02 per cent of global GDP , because the increased ferocity would be more than made up by increased prosperity and resilience .",0
"Yet , a new study of 60 climate models and scenarios shows this warning fails to take into account the fact that global warming will mean precipitation increases . Indeed , water flow will actually increase over this century , which is likely beneficial in increasing “ water availability in the Indus Basin irrigation scheme during the spring growing seasons . ” If our climate conversation managed to include the good along with the bad , we would have a much better understanding of our options .",6
A climate economics approach finds that today – contrary to the alarmists ’ massive insistence on negatives-only stories – global warming causes about as much damage as benefits .,5
"Over time , climate becomes a net problem : by the 2070s , the UN Climate Panel finds that global warming will likely cause damage equivalent to 0.2 per cent to 2 per cent of global GDP . This is certainly not a trivial cost , but nor is it the end of the world . It is perhaps half the social cost of alcohol today .",0
The Paris climate treaty will cost around 2 per cent of global GDP and fix much less than a tenth of the problem .,0
Electric cars provide perhaps a thousandth in climate benefit of their substantial public subsidies .,0

"The methodology widely used to understand sea temperatures in the scientific community may be based on a mistake , the new study suggests , and so our understanding of climate change might be fundamentally flawed .",8
"The new research suggests that the oceans hundreds of millions of years ago were much cooler than we thought . If true , that means that the global warming we are currently undergoing is unparallelled within the last 100 million years , and far worse than we had previously calculated .",8

"Thawing permafrost can release not just CO2 , but also methane , a much stronger heat-trapping gas .",6
Since CO2 is the primary heat-trapping greenhouse gas — and since the permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the atmosphere does today — this means a vicious cycle has begun that will speed up global warming .,4
But it has little to do with what recent headlines have been saying about the hottest year ever . It is called business as usual .,6
"Until last June , most scientists acknowledged that warming reached a peak in the late 1990s , and since then had plateaued in a “ hiatus. ”",8

Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red .,1
"There is a popular theory that atmospheric CO2 amplifies the creation of water vapor , thereby increasing warming through a “ positive feedback loop. ” But that theory so far is mostly speculative ; climate projections using models based on it have consistently failed , nearly always predicting far more warming than has occurred .",2
"It should go without saying that if scientists can not yet make accurate predictions about future climate change , then their understanding of climate science remains highly incomplete .",10

The science is far from settled .,3

"Americans receive a daily barrage from the fake news media and climate “ experts ” reporting that each and every day , week , month or year is the hottest on record due to global warming .",9

The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate .,2

Many of these fear mongers also say we should stop burning fossil fuels that are causing this mayhem .,9
Is the Earth truly experiencing the hottest weather on record ? Absolutely not .,2
"These zealots would like you to believe that due to fossil fuel emissions , summers are now longer and hotter while winters are shorter and milder .",9

"We hope these examples , right out of the weather record books , compiled by C.C . Burt in his book Extreme Weather Changes , will help you to understand the scams alarmists are trying to pull .",8
These examples all illustrate that cherry-picking record high temperatures in isolated locations tells absolutely nothing about the Earth ’ s climate .,6
"The strongest heat wave ever recorded occurred in July 1936 , generating high temperatures in half of America ’ s 50 states . In 1935 , fossil fuel emissions were 25 times lower than today .",7
"Interesting that the figure above shows the most severe historic cold wave during the past century took place in 1936 , which was the same year when the strongest heat wave took place .",7
"However , since 1998 , little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase . This is totally consistent with variations in the amount of heat the Earth receives from the Sun .",7

"In 2007 , with the aid of scientists such as Wieslaw Maslowski and Peter Wadhams , the BBC and others were telling us that the Arctic would be totally “ ice free by 2013 ” ( the Independent even cleared its front page to announce that the ice could all have disappeared within weeks ) . By 2011 , the BBC ’ s science editor Richard Black was telling us that the ice would “ probably be gone within this decade ” . In 2012 , his colleague Roger Harrabin was reporting that the sea ice was now melting so fast that more had vanished that summer than “ at any time since satellite records began ” .",6
"Al Gore , set out to paddle a kayak to the North Pole – only to have to abort his trip after a few days because “ the ice was too thick ” . In 2009 , the three-man Caitlin expedition , sponsored by a “ climate risk ” insurance company , and backed by the BBC and the Prince of Wales , set out to walk to the North Pole . Their intention was to measure the thickness of the vanishing ice with an electronic instrument , but it froze so hard that they had to resort to a tape measure . Again , after a few weeks , they had to be airlifted back to a rescue ship because the constantly shifting ice was “ too thick ” .",6
But wasn ’ t the whole point of this warming that it was meant to be “ global ” ?,6
Two events last week brought yet further twists to one of the longest-running farces of our modern world .,9
"One was the revelation by the European Space Agency that in 2013 and 2014 , after years when the volume of Arctic ice had been diminishing , it increased again by as much as 33 per cent . The other was that Canadian scientists studying the effect of climate change on Arctic ice from an icebreaker had to suspend their research , when their vessel was called to the aid of other ships trapped in the thickest summer ice seen in Hudson Bay for 20 years .",6
"In 2012 , his colleague Roger Harrabin was reporting that the sea ice was now melting so fast that more had vanished that summer than “ at any time since satellite records began ” .",6
"In December 2013 , the world followed agog the plight of yet another “ scientific expedition ” , when 52 climate activists , accompanied by reporters from the BBC and the Guardian , sailed into the Antarctic to measure the effects of global warming on its sea-ice . By Christmas their ship was so dangerously trapped by thick , multi-year ice that they had to be helicoptered to a Chinese ship 10 miles away , which itself then got so trapped in ice that they had to be airlifted again to two other ships even further away .",6

"But , alas , it just isn ’ t happening .",6
In recent years there has been more polar ice in the world than at any time since satellite records began in 1979 .,6
"In the very year they had forecast that the Arctic would be “ ice free ” , its thickness increased by a third . Polar bear numbers are rising , not falling . Temperatures in Greenland have shown no increase for decades .",6
The greatest scare story of all simply isn ’ t turning out as their computer models predicted .,6

"If we were so passionately concerned about our carbon footprint , then the best thing to do is to expire .",3
"In our lifetime , there has been no correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature .",7
"On a larger scale , the ice caps show that after a natural orbitally driven warming , atmospheric carbon dioxide content increases 800 years later . Rather than atmos­pheric carbon dioxide driving temperature , it is the opposite .",7
Geology shows us again there is no correlation between atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature . Each of the six major past ice ages began when the atmospheric carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present .,7
"The attack on emissions of the gas of life is an irrational attack on industry , our modern way of life , freedoms and prosperity .",4
"By ignoring history and geology , any claim of unusual weather can be made sensational .",6
The geological history of the planet shows major planetary climate changes have never been driven by a trace gas . Just because we are alive today does not mean we change major planetary systems that operated for billions of years .,8
"These processes involve a transfer of energy , and water vapour makes the atmosphere behave like a giant airconditioner .",2
Water is 12 times more effective than carbon dioxide with respect to all incoming and outgoing radiation .,0
"In the past , warming has never been a threat to life on Earth . Why should it be now ?",8
We are not living in a period of catastrophic climate change . The past tells us it ’ s business as usual .,8
It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming .,6
"Carbon dioxide is plant food . It is neither a pollutant nor a toxin . Without carbon dioxide , all life on Earth would die .",12
The fossil record shows that a thriving and diversification of plant and animal life occurs every time the atmosphere had a very high carbon dioxide content .,7
The role of the sun and clouds was not considered important by modellers . They are the major drivers for the climate on our planet .,5
"When there is a low atmospheric carbon dioxide content , especially during very cold times , life struggles .",11

It will slow the world ’ s economic growth to force a shift to inefficient green energy sources .,12
"My peer-reviewed research , published last November in the journal Global Policy , shows that even if every nation were to fulfill all their carbon-cutting promises by 2030 and stick to them all the way through the century—at a cost of more than $ 100 trillion in lost GDP—global temperature rise would be reduced by a tiny 0.3°F ( 0.17°C ) .",0
"Instead of simply mandating less carbon output , we need more R & D spending on green energy , including more efficient fission and fusion , cheaper solar and wind , and improved storage . New technology is crucial if green energy is to out-compete fossil fuels .",6
"Tackling issues like poverty , health care , corruption and domestic violence would do even more .",5
"At a cost of between $ 1 trillion and $ 2 trillion annually , the Paris climate agreement , recently ratified by China , is likely to be history ’ s most expensive treaty .",4

"And while it ’ s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s , there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice .",6
Some cancers induce a muscle-wasting syndrome that leads to faster-than-usual weight loss . This is likely what happened to the emaciated Baffin Island bear captured on video in July 2017 and promoted by National Geographic late last year .,1

"One reason that the 2007 predictions of future polar bear survival were so far off base is that the model developed by American biologist Steven Amstrup ( now at Polar Bears International , an NGO ) assumed any polar bear population decline would be caused by less summer ice , despite the Beaufort Sea experience .",8
"This increase may not be statistically significant , but it is decidedly not the 67-per-cent decline that was predicted given the ice conditions that prevailed .",5

"There is also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like the Amazon , which in 2010 suffered its second “ hundred-year drought ” in the space of five years , could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of devastating , rolling forest fires — which would not only expel enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the size of the forest .

The international team onboard the Russian research ship R/V Akademik Keldysh said most of the bubbles were currently dissolving in the water but methane levels at the surface were four to eight times what would normally be expected and this was venting into the atmosphere .,6
"High levels of the potent greenhouse gas have been detected down to a depth of 350 metres in the Laptev Sea near Russia , prompting concern among researchers that the discovery could have “ serious climate consequences ” .",6
"The Arctic is considered ground zero in the debate about the vulnerability of frozen methane deposits – which have been called the “ sleeping giants of the carbon cycle ” - in the ocean , and if releases were to exceed a tipping point it could increase the speed of global heating .",6
"Methane seeps detected in the past were found to be historic , but the expedition believes these are new based on an earlier study showing movement of the subsea permafrost between the early 1980s and 2015 .",8

"“ It ’ s sobering to think of this magnificent landscape and how fundamentally it can change over a relatively short time period , ” he added .",4
"Estimates vary on how much carbon is currently released from thawing permafrost worldwide , but by one calculation emissions over the rest of the century could average about 1.5 billion tons a year , or about the same as current annual emissions from fossil-fuel burning in the United States .",6
"In addition to greenhouse gas emissions , thawing wreaks havoc on infrastructure , causing slumping of land when ice loses volume as it turns to water .",4

"Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man-made CO2 we ’ ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath . First it will kill off all the calcified marine life , such as shellfish , corals and plankton . Then it will destroy all the species that depend on it — causing an almighty mass extinction which will wipe out the fishing industry and turn our oceans into a barren zone of death .",1
"Unfortunately for the doom-mongers , we sceptics have just received some heavy fire-support from a neutral authority .",9
"Howard Browman , a marine scientist for 35 years , has published a review in the ICES Journal of Marine Science of all the papers published on the subject . His verdict could hardly be more damning . The methodology used by the studies was often flawed ; contrary studies suggesting that ocean acidification wasn ’ t a threat had sometimes had difficulty finding a publisher .",8
"Why , between 2009 and 2014 , did Defra spend a whopping £12.5 million on an ocean acidification research programme when the issue could have been resolved , for next to nothing , after a few hours ’ basic research ?",12
"According to a report last year by Climate Change Business Journal , it ’ s now worth an astonishing $ 1.5 trillion — about the same as the online shopping industry . If the scare goes away , then all bets are off , because the entire global decarbonisation business relies on it .",0
"Ocean acidification — the evidence increasingly suggests — is a trivial , misleadingly named , and not remotely worrying phenomenon which has been hyped up beyond all measure for political , ideological and financial reasons .",6
"The impact on calcification , metabolism , growth , fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units ( beyond what is considered a plausible reduction this century ) is beneficial , not damaging . Marine life has nothing whatsoever to fear from ocean acidification .",0
"Hence the need for a fallback position — an environmental theory which would justify the massively expensive and disruptive ongoing decarbonisation programme so assiduously championed by politicians , scientists , green campaigners and anyone making money out of the renewables business .",9
"What it does do is lend credence to something we much-maligned sceptics have long been saying : that in many environmental fields , the science is being abused and distorted to promote a political and financial agenda .",6
"It ’ s no wonder he should find it worrying , for it has been assiduously promoted by environmentalists for more than a decade now as ‘ global warming ’ s evil twin ’ .",4

"To those of us who have been studying the global warming scare in some detail , the answer is depressingly obvious . It ’ s because in the last decade or so , the climate change industry has become so vast and all encompassing , employing so many people , it simply can not be allowed to fail .",5
"An “ inherent bias ” in scientific journals in favour of more calamitous predictions has excluded research showing that marine creatures are not damaged by ocean acidification , which is caused by the sea absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .",6
"The review found that many studies had used flawed methods , subjecting marine creatures to sudden increases in carbon dioxide that would never be experienced in real life .",6
"“ In some cases it was levels far beyond what would ever be reached even if we burnt every molecule of carbon on the planet , ” Howard Browman , the editor of ICES Journal of Marine Science , who oversaw the review , said .",6
"Dr Browman , who is also principal research scientist at the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research , found there had been huge increase in articles on ocean acidification in recent years , rising from five in 2005 to 600 last year . He said that a handful of influential scientific journals and lobbying by international organisations had turned ocean acidification into a major issue .",7

"While it is too early to know if the recent , rapid decline in Antarctic sea ice is going to be a regular occurrence like in the Arctic , it “ certainly puts the kibosh on everyone saying that Antarctica ’ s ice is just going up and up , ” Meier said .",1
"Moreover , the study says , massive human greenhouse gas emissions since that time have likely “ postponed ” what might otherwise be another ice age “ by at least 100,000 years . ”",1

"Indeed , they note that about 800,000 years ago , orbital alignments were similar but carbon dioxide concentrations were around 240 parts per million , and glaciation did indeed occur .",8
"But as an energy expert asked by Congress to provide objective expert testimony , and invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) to serve as Expert Reviewer of its next Assessment Report , I feel an obligation to apologize for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public .",8

"But there are also reasons to believe that environmental alarmism will , if not come to an end , have diminishing cultural power . The coronavirus pandemic is an actual crisis that puts the climate “ crisis ” into perspective . Even if you think we have overreacted , Covid-19 has killed nearly 500,000 people and shattered economies around the globe .",5

Plimer says every occurrence of icebergs expanding and shrinking happened with “ more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than now ” .,7
"“ We are getting towards the end of the warm period , the peak of the warmth was about 5,000 years ago and we are heading for the next inevitable ice age , ” he told Sky News host Cory Bernardi .",6
"They live in a world where conditions are so extreme that fire seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres overlap , stretching resources at a time when they ’ re needed most .",4
And when temperatures head towards this threshold it starts to impact the ability of people to lead normal lives .,4
"At home , Australia emits less than 1.24 per cent of global emissions , but so do most countries . More than 170 countries emit less than Australia each year , and combined , this group of countries emits more than any of the largest emitters — 40 per cent of all emissions come from countries that each emit less than 2 per cent of global emissions . So , even if the major emitters decarbonise , it won ’ t be enough .",0
"In this scenario , by 2100 , 73.9 per cent of the world ’ s population will be facing at least 20 days a year of deadly heat and humidity . And before you think that 20 days of this sort of heat is manageable , that ’ s just a minimum .",1
"By this point you ’ ve seen a few summers , probably run through a few sprinklers , burnt your feet on hot pavement — six-year-old you knows what hot feels like .",4
"Economic productivity decreases , and the sorts of activities that are a central part of Australian life — like playing sport or heading to the beach — are affected . As the globe continues to warm , this sort of heat will spread , affecting more and more people for longer and longer periods of time .",4
"The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires , which claimed the lives of 173 Australians , are etched into the national consciousness . But in the heatwave that led up to the fires , the number of deaths soared .",4
In this scenario they may still have the opportunity to visit a living Great Barrier Reef .,4
"As countries get more peaceful in Africa we could lose more tropical forests , which really worries me . ”",3
"“ It breaks my heart to think we ’ d lose half our tropical forests for plantations just to save ourselves , ” Lawrence said . “ It ’ s horrifying that we ’ d lose our biodiversity to avert climate change .",4
Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara . ”,12
"Lawrence said a steep drop in emissions to zero by 2040 would negate the need for “ negative emissions ” technology that would damage forests ’ ability to suck up carbon , maintain local water supplies and weather patterns and provide a home for a riot of birds , mammals , insects and other creatures .",3
"But looking to the future , mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef will likely be an annual phenomenon within a decade , Torda said .",1
