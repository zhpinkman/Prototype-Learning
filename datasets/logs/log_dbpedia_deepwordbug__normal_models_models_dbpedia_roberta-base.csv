"Augustus [[George]] [[Hazard]] ([[April]] 28, 1802 – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an [[American]] manufacturer of [[gunpowder]] and the namesake of Hazardville, [[Connecticut]]. Hazard was [[born]] in Kingston, Rhode Island on April 28, 1802, a [[son]] of Thomas and Silence Knowles Hazard. [[His]] family moved to Connecticut when he was six years old. As a young man, he worked as a merchant in Savannah, Georgia. In 1827 he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission agent engaged in the sale of gunpowder and other products. In 1837 he bought into a gunpowder production company that had been established two years earlier on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed sole ownership of the company in 1843. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the village that supported it became known as Hazardville. During the early years of the Civil War, Col. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina seceded from the Union, it bought 80,000 lbs. of [[powder]] that was used to propel the first shots fired on Fort Sumter.

He was a Republican who voted for Lincoln and [[Grant]] for President, and after 1872 became a Democrat. After serving as a prosecutor in Butler County, Ohio from 1876–1880, Campbell was elected as a Democrat to the [[United]] States House of Representatives twice from Ohio's 7th congressional district ([[Forty-eighth]] and Fiftieth Congresses) and once from the third district ([[Forty-ninth]] Congress), a [[seat]] once held by his [[uncle]] Lewis D.

During his term as governor, he signed a bill enacting the Australian ballot in Ohio. He called a special session of the General Assembly to remove the corrupt government of the city of Cincinnati. This action cost him the support of Democrats in that part of the state, and prevented his re-election. He was unsuccessful in a third run for governor in 1895. Campbell was a trustee of the Ohio [[State]] University 1895-1896. Remaining politically active, Campbell was a [[delegate]] to the Democratic National Conventions in 1892, 1920, and 1924. He served on the commission to codify the State of Ohio laws from 1908-1911. Campbell was nominated for Congress in 1906, but lost, and was his party's choice for Senator in 1908, but was again defeated. In 1913, Campbell was appointed a trustee of the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society, and he was elected unanimously by the Board of Trustees as president on September 25, 1918.

"Russells [[Hall]] [[Hospital]] is an NHS general [[hospital]] [[located]] in Dudley, [[West]] Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. [[The]] [[hospital]] is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first [[planned]] in the 1960s as a general [[hospital]] for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to [[patients]] until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. [[The]] new [[hospital]] [[included]] an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity [[services]] but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished.

In the [[juornal's]] words, it \""offers bold arguments for a reinvigorated conservatism, which draws upon the timeless principles of the American Founding and applies them to the moral and political problems we face today. By engaging policy at the level of ideas, the CRB aims to reawaken in American politics a statesmanship and citizenship worthy of our noblest political traditions.\"" A typical [[issu]] consists of several book [[revieOs]] and a selection of essays on topics of conservatism and political philosophy, history, and literature. It began [[publishng]] in its present form in 2000, under the editorship of Charles Kesler. Contributors have included Harry [[Jamffa]], Mark Helprin (a columnist for the magazine), Victor Davis Hanson, Diana Schaub, Gerard Alexander, Allen C. [[GuePzo]], Joseph Epstein, Hadley Arkes, John Marini, and William F. Buckley, Jr..Elliott Banfield is the journal's art director. Martha Bayles is the [[maagzine's]] film and television critic. The staff includes senior editor Christopher Flannery and William [[Voegelsi]], managing editor John B. [[KiHenker]], and associate editor Kathleen Arnn. Joseph Tartakovsky is a contributing editor. “It is a joy to read the Claremont Review of Books,” says Victor Davis Hanson. Scott Johnson of Power Line blog writes that “One of the reasons that the Claremont Review of Books is my [[fpavorite]] [[magazien]] is that each [[iSssue]] constitutes a virtual education in politics.” Milton Friedman said that “Each issue of the Claremont Review of Books covers an extraordinary wide range of books, each well and thoughtfully reviewed and is introduced by a gem of a comment by its literate editor, Charles R. Kesler. I recommend it highly.” Norman Podhoretz said “In my judgment, the Claremont Review of Books is [[noe]] of the [[besW]] edited and [[bezst]] [[writtne]] [[agazines]] of any kind in America, and an invaluable center of conservative thought on a rich and varied range of [[subjeOts]] to the [[disKcussion]] of which it [[unfailbngly]] brings to bear the highest order of critical intelligence.” Charles R. Kesler's \""Democracy and the [[uBsh]] Doctrine\"" was reprinted in an anthology of conservative writings on the Iraq War, edited by Commentary Managing Editor Gary Rosen. The CRB was party to a high-profile exchange in Commentary between Editor-at-Large Norman Podhoretz and CRB editor Charles R. Kesler and CRB contributors and Claremont Institute senior fellows Mark Helprin and Angelo M.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records.

The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"".

Originally planned for release on the [[GameCube]] in November 2005, Twilight [[Princess]] was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the [[game]], add more content, and port it to the [[Wii]]. The Wii version was released alongside the console in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month. The GameCube version was released worldwide in December 2006. The story focuses on series protagonist Link, who tries to prevent [[Hyrule]] from being engulfed by a corrupted parallel dimension known as the Twilight Realm. To do so, he takes the form of both a Hylian and a wolf, and is assisted by a mysterious creature named Midna.

The page count was expanded, the format changed to a [[perfect-boun]] [[magaizne]], and color was added to all of the [[pgaes]], the page count was increased, and the format enlarged (all concepts Brock had predicted would be needed to continue the magazine).

Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg [[1979]] (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his [[3rd]]= finish at Sochi in 1982. Nowadays less active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to win smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as Solin-Split 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) [[2005]]. At the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, [[winning]] a total of 2 silver [[medals]] and 2 bronze. At the European Team Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver. His chess playing style has been described as aggressive and this may be a result of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first coached by Viktor Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a senior master as a tutor/mentor. In his case the master was Mikhail Tal, an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","Oleg Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[borj]] [[g0]] [[Jnauary]] [[195]] in [[LvXv]]) is a Ukrainian chess [[granjdmaster]] and [[formeer]] [[Europaen]] junior champion.

The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,279 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The used first precovery was taken at Turku Observatory in 1942, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery. However, the asteroid was already imaged in 1907, at Taunton in Massachusetts (803). A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory in November 2010.

"[[Pandora]] (/pænˈdɔərə/ [[pan-DOHR-ə]]; Greek: Πανδώρα) is an inner [[satellite]] of Saturn. It was [[discovered]] in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 [[probe]], and was provisionally designated S/1980 S 26. In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated as Saturn XVII. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring.

It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in [[diameter]]. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with [[debris]]. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's [[surface]]. The [[orbit]] of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus.

"[[3043]] San Diego, provisional designation [[1982]] [[SA]], is a [[stony]] Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

[[The]] bright [[E-type]] [[asteroid]] is a [[member]] of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months ([[977]] [[days]]). [[Its]] orbit has an eccentricity of 0.[[11]] and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first [[observation]] was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's [[observation]] arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.[[60]] in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the [[asteroid]] [[measures]] 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its [[surface]] has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative [[Asteroid]] Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. [[The]] minor [[planet]] was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the [[site]] were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory.

"The Milwaukee [[Does]] were a [[team]] in the short-lived [[Women's]] Professional [[Basketball]] League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

"[[Lance]] [[Gooden]] ([[born]] [[December]] 1, [[1982]]) is a [[former]] and incoming [[Republican]] member of the Texas [[House]] of Representatives for District 4 (Kaufman and a portion of Henderson counties). [[In]] the [[2010]] primary election, [[Gooden]] with 50.5 percent of the vote upset the six-term incumbent Republican [[Representative]] [[Betty]] Brown. Gooden had formerly been Brown's legislative assistant. A native of [[Terrell]] in Kaufman [[County]], a city [[east]] of Dallas, Texas, Gooden graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, from which he received both a Bachelor of Arts in government and a Bachelor of Business Administration. Upon taking [[office]] early in 2011, [[Gooden]] worked on the state budget in an attempt to eliminate wasteful spending. He served on these House committees: Appropriations, County Affairs, and House Administration, the latter of which handles employment by the House. In 2010, Gooden had no Democratic opponent in his heavily Republican district. Gooden won renomination to a second term in the Republican primary held on [[May]] 29, 2012. He polled 6,385 votes (53.5 percent) to 5,545 (46.5 percent) for his opponent, Stuart Spitzer, a surgeon from Kaufman, who was born and reared in Athens in Henderson County. Gooden was then unopposed for his second term in the general election held on November 6, [[2012]]. However, on March 4, 2014, Dr. Spitzer, in a second bid for the office, unseated Gooden in the Republican primary. Spitzer polled 8,421 votes (51 percent) to Gooden's 8,079 (49 percent). Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, made a campaign stop for Gooden's behalf in Forney in Kaufman County, a month before the primary election.

"Edward Mann was a London-based hatmaker and milliner popular in the second half of the 20th century.

"[[Martin]] Bruce [[Cameron]] ([[born]] 24 August [[1936]]), Australian [[politician]], was a member of the Australian [[Senate]] and the South Australian Legislative Council. In 1968 Cameron contested the safe Labor House of Assembly seat of Millicent for the Liberal and Country League (LCL) after objecting to the views of incumbent Des Corcoran on road transport control. Cameron gained a 13% swing but lost by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the Court of [[Disputed]] Returns, which ordered a [[by-election]]. Corcoran comfortably won the by-election. Early in 1969, Senator Keith Laught died suddenly and Cameron was nominated by Premier Steele Hall as his replacement. However, Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the vacancy was held to coincide with the 1969 Federal Election in October and he was defeated by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). Cameron entered South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the retirement of Sir Norman Jude. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible moderate forces within the party. Cameron often opposed his fellow LCL Legislative [[Councillors]], due to his support for Universal [[Suffrage]] for that [[chamber]]. This tension within the [[LCL]] led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the following year. Led by Hall and Robin Millhouse, the movement originally functioned as a [[faction]] within the LCL.

He held this position until his retirement from politics in 1990. Following his retirement from the Council, Cameron served a term as president of the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party.

"[[Willie]] “[[The]] [[Wisp]]” Galimore ([[March]] 30, 1935 – July [[27]], [[1964]]) was an [[American]] [[football]] running [[back]] for the [[Chicago]] Bears from 1957–1963. [[He]] attended Florida A&M University, working with the legendary coach Jake Gaither. Galimore is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Galimore possessed incredible speed and lateral movement; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed Galimore could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. His running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before NFL scouting became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the 5th round of the 1956 NFL draft. Galimore's peers (including Chuck Bednarik and Doug Atkins) referred to Galimore as one of the best runners they ever faced. Galimore was killed in an automobile accident on July 27, 1964 in [[Rensselaer]], Indiana at the age of 29 with teammate Bo Farrington. His number 28 has been retired by the Bears.

The defining [[feature]] of this [[fungal]] group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός ([[askos]]), meaning \""[[sac]]\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some [[species]] of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual [[species]] from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on [[morphological]] or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by [[phylogenetic]] analyses of DNA sequences. The [[ascomycetes]] are a [[monophyletic]] group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for medicinally important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants.

"[[Ishpatina]] [[Ridge]] is the highest [[point]] of [[land]] in the Canadian [[province]] of Ontario, at an estimated [[693]] m (2,274 ft) above sea level.

[[It]] was only truly recognized as [[Ontario's]] highest [[point]] after federal government [[topographical]] mapping revealed this fact in the 1970s. Before then, the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher. The [[ridge]] lies in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial [[Park]]. Due to its remote [[location]], Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to reach. The closest major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 km north. There are a few logging roads and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular [[approach]] route to Ishpatina is by canoe/[[portage]] via a logging road to the south out of the town of Capreol north of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are numerous portages making it particularly onerous. This route has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/snowshoe. Historically, a fire tower atop the ridge was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane. The name \""Ishpatina\"" comes from an Ojibwe language word ishpadinaa, meaning \""high place/ridge\"".

"The West Coast Main [[Line]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[route]] in the United Kingdom. It is Britain's most important rail backbone in terms of population served. The route links Greater London, the West Midlands, the North West, North Wales and the Central Belt of Scotland. The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger route in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains. Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h). The WCML has a significantly higher number of curves than most other main lines in Britain, hence the requirement for tilting operation for higher speeds.","The West Coast Main [[Lie]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[roufe]] in the United Kingdom.

"Federal [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats.

However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment, Müller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Müller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag.

He served in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1974 to 1979, was the state's Attorney General from 1980 to 1983, and was the 49th Lieutenant Governor from 1983 to 1987. After graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced [[law]] in New [[York]] before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a consumer advocate. He [[parlayed]] that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady [[Phyllis]] George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race.

In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a [[means]] of further funding social [[programs]] like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election.

"Koi wa Ina Mono Myōna Mono or also known as Koiha Ina Mono Mouna Mono (恋は異なもの妙なもの, trans. Love is a Strange and Different Thing) is a fictional [[manga]] [[written]] and [[illustrated]] by Japanese author Taishi Zaō (also known for her shōjo works under the name Mikiyo Tsuda) in 2002. [[The]] [[story]] focuses on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of [[sorts]]. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday [[realize]] he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as [[reading]] [[porn]] while in [[class]]. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura [[passes]] out after seeing fellow [[student]] Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

"[[The]] men's 100 metres was of [[one]] of [[23]] [[track]] [[events]] of the athletics at the 2004 Summer [[Olympics]], in [[Athens]]. [[It]] was [[contested]] at the Athens Olympic [[Stadium]], from [[August]] 21 to 22, by a total of 84 [[sprinters]] from 63 nations. In the first [[round]], the first three runners from each of the ten heats, together with the ten next fastest runners from all heats (10×3+10=40), automatically qualified for the second round.

In the semifinals, only the first four runners from each of the two heats advanced to the final (2×4=8). The final was the fastest and most disputed in Olympic history, with six runners covering the distance in 10.00 seconds or less (four of them under the 9.90 mark), and the gold and bronze medalist athletes separated by 0.02 seconds. In the final, the slowest to react was Justin [[Gatlin]], still with the most powerful first steps, Gatlin led from the gun, with Kim Collins, the next slowest to react, also getting a typically fast start (typically in lane 1).

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

[[The]] engagement was inconclusive and is most [[notable]] for the sinking of the English carrack Mary Rose. In 1545, Francis launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships. Against this armada — larger than the Spanish Armada forty-three years later — the English had about 80 ships and 12,000 soldiers. The French expedition started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon perishing in an accidental fire at anchor in the Seine on 6 July 1545. Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his flag to La Maistresse which then ran aground as the fleet set sail. The leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the Channel. The French entered the Solent and landed troops on the Isle of Wight and the Sussex coast. The French invasion force which had landed at the Isle of Wight were defeated, and forced to retreat, by a local militia in the Battle of Bonchurch. [[On]] 18 July 1545 the English came out of Portsmouth and engaged the French at long range, little damage being done on either side. [[La]] Maitresse was on the point of sinking due to the damage she had sustained earlier but although d'Annebault had to change his flagship again she was saved from foundering. [[On]] the night of 18 July Henry dined aboard Great Harry, the flagship of Admiral John Dudley, Viscount Lisle. The next day was calm, and the French employed their galleys against the immobile English vessels. Toward evening a [[breeze]] [[sprang]] up and as Mary Rose, the [[flagship]] of Vice Admiral [[George]] Carew, advanced to battle, she foundered and [[sank]] with the [[loss]] of all but [[35]]–40 of her crew. [[The]] exact [[reasons]] for the sinking are not known, but it was believed at the time that the crew had been negligent and forgot to close the lower gunports after firing at the galleys, so that when she heeled over in the breeze she took on water and turned over. A witness on board the French [[fleet]] [[believed]] that the galleys had sunk her, [[though]] this is not supported by other contemporary [[accounts]] and no physical evidence of this remains.

[[Lt]] Maitresse was on the point of sinking due to the damage she had sustained earlier but although d'Annebault had to change his flagship again she was saved from foundering. [[O]] the night of 18 July Henry dined aboard Great Harry, the flagship of Admiral John Dudley, Viscount Lisle. The next day was calm, and the French employed their galleys against the immobile English vessels. Toward evening a [[brezee]] [[spranN]] up and as Mary Rose, the [[xlagship]] of Vice Admiral [[Gorge]] Carew, advanced to battle, she foundered and [[san]] with the [[losTs]] of all but [[53]]–40 of her crew.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor.

"The Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] (also known as the New Jersey [[Cut-Off]] or Hopatcong-Slateford [[Cut-Off]]) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the [[Cut-Off]] was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered [[high-speed]] travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The [[Cut-Off]] was 11 miles (18 [[km]]) shorter than the [[Lackawanna]] Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling [[gradient]] (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer [[curves]], with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.

"Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria. Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian dissidents. Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul in May to discuss regime change, and Turkey hosts the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad al-Asaad. Turkey has become increasingly hostile to the Assad government's policies and has encouraged reconciliation among dissident factions. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been trying to \""cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad.\"" Beginning in May 2012, some Syrian opposition fighters began being armed and trained by the Turkish National Intelligence Organisation. Turkey maintains a small enclave within Syria itself, the Tomb of Suleyman Shah on the right bank of the Euphrates in Aleppo Province, near the village of Qarah Qawzak (Karakozak). The Tomb is guarded by a small permanent garrison of Turkish soldiers, who continue to rotate in from a battalion based at the Turkish border some 25 kilometres (16 mi) away, even as the civil war unfolded around them. Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. Following the incident, the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoğan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory. Any act of aggression against it would be an attack on our territory and NATO territory.\"" Analysts have cited the tomb as a potential future flashpoint in Turkish-Syrian relations.","Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria. Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian dissidents. Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul in May to discuss regime change, and Turkey hosts the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad al-Asaad. Turkey has become increasingly hostile to the Assad government's policies and has encouraged reconciliation among dissident factions.

"The Taradale [[Viaduct]] is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line.

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' [[Keenor]] (31 July 1894 – November 1972) was a Welsh professional [[footballer]] and Wales international. He [[began]] his career at his hometown club [[Cardiff]] City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he [[fought]] in the Battle of the [[Somme]], suffering a severe shrapnel [[wound]] to his [[thigh]] in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division [[one]] season after joining the Football League in [[1920]] and helping the club to an [[FA]] [[Cup]] final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 [[defeat]] to [[Sheffield]] United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA [[Cup]] Final later in the season, where they defeated [[Arsenal]] 1–0.

On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the [[Bar]] on 17 [[May]] [[1636]]. As a barrister, Hale [[represented]] a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil [[War]], including Thomas Wentworth and William [[Laud]]; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist [[loss]], [[Hale's]] reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common [[Pleas]]. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles [[II's]] reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration.

"Herbert [[Alexander]] [[Bruce]] FRCS ([[September]] [[28]], 1868 – June [[23]], [[1963]]), [[served]] as the [[15th]] [[Lieutenant]] Governor of Ontario, [[Canada]], from 1932 to 1937. [[Born]] in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a surgeon at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He owned Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir [[Sam]] Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his [[appointment]] was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's report was [[disowned]] by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his [[duties]], while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as [[surgical]] [[consultant]] to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, [[including]] [[greater]] reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating [[room]] technicians. In [[1920]], Bruce purchased a [[farm]] on [[Bayview]] [[Avenue]] [[overlooking]] the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the [[Hepburn]] government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

"Saint [[Demetrius]] the Neomartyr (Greek: Άγιος Δημήτριος Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος Δημήτριος Ο Νέος) is an Orthodox Christian saint, commemorated on [[14]] [[April]] in the Church of Greece. [[Demetrius]] was a Greek [[Orthodox]] Christian [[boy]] [[born]] in Floka and [[raised]] in Ligouditsa, both in the region of Arcadia, [[near]] the regional capital of Tripoli. As with most of Greece at the time, the region was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. [[His]] mother died when he was very young, and his father, Elias, remarried. [[Due]] to ill-treatment by his stepmother, Demetrius left home and [[went]] to [[seek]] work in Tripoli, where he was [[apprenticed]] to a barber. He converted to Islam and took the name Mehmet, but later repented and became an Orthodox [[monk]] on the island of Chios. Demetrius fell into a deep depression when the [[weight]] of his [[sin]] fully weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his conversion to Islam. His abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity several times. This included him going to his former barber boss and asking him to slit his throat right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did.

Demetrius fell into a deep depression when the [[weigh]] of his [[si]] fully weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his conversion to Islam. His abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity several times. This included him going to his former barber boss and asking him to slit his throat right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did.

"[[Actinostrobus]] is a [[genus]] of coniferous trees in the Cupressaceae (cypress family). Common names include cypress, sandplain-cypress and cypress-pine, the last of these shared by the closely related genus Callitris.

They are shrubs or small trees, reaching 3–8 m (9.8–26.2 ft) tall. The leaves are evergreen, of two forms; juvenile needle-like leaves 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long on young [[seedlings]] (but occasional into adulthood in A. acuminatus), and scale-like adult leaves, 2–8 mm (0.[[079]]–0.315 in) long with only the apex free. The leaves are arranged in six rows along the [[twigs]], in alternating whorls of three. The male cones are small, 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) long, and are located at the tips of the [[twigs]]. The female cones start out similarly inconspicuous, maturing in eighteen to twenty months to 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long and wide, globular to acute-ovoid, with six thick, woody scales, arranged in two whorls of three, and a further nine to fifteen thin, sterile basal scales. The cones remain closed on the trees for many years, opening only after being [[scorched]] by a [[bushfire]]; this then releases the [[seeds]] to grow on the newly cleared burnt [[ground]].

"Col de Pierre Pertuis (el. 827 m.) is a [[mountain]] [[pass]] in the Jura [[Mountains]] in the [[canton]] of Bern in [[Switzerland]]. It connects Sonceboz and Tavannes. The [[name]] of the [[pass]] comes from the Latin: Petra pertusa, meaning broken rock. The pass road has been dated to the second half of the 1st century AD. A 159 by 96 centimetres (63 in × 38 in) large inscription on the north side of the road lists Marcus Dunius Paternus, the duumvir of the Helvetii Colony Aventicum, as the builder of the road. This inscription honors the emperor and dates to around 200 AD. It probably refers to the renovation and expansion of the existing road and the widening of the rocky gate leading into the pass. The pass road connected the Aventicum (modern Avenches)-Salodurum (modern Solothurn)-Augusta Raurica road with the Vesontio (modern Besançon)-Epomanduodurum (modern Mandeure)-Kembs road. The pass was first mentioned in a record from 1179 as the boundary between the dioceses of Lausanne and Basel. It remained the border between the powerful bishops until the Protestant Reformation. The first modern road was built in 1752 by the Abbot of Moutier-Grandval Abbey and the Vogt of Erguel. This road linked the cities of Basel and Biel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, the pass became part of France. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, the pass and the surrounding area were assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815.

"[[Ellis]] [[Edgar]] \""[[Puss]]\"" [[Achong]] (16 February 1904 – 29 August [[1986]]) was a [[sportsman]] from [[Trinidad]] and Tobago in the West Indies. He played [[cricket]] for the West Indies and was the first person of known Chinese descent to play in a Test match. Left-arm unorthodox spin (left-arm wrist spin) is sometimes known as \""slow left-arm chinaman\"" (SLC) which is thought to be in his honour. Achong was [[born]] in Belmont, Port of Spain. He played football as a left-winger for a local team, Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and represented Trinidad and Tobago from 1919 to 1932. Achong is better known for playing cricket. He was mainly a bowler. His stock ball was left-arm orthodox spin (left-arm finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire Joe Hardstaff Sr., \""[[fancy]] being done by a bloody [[Chinaman]]\"". Learie Constantine is said to have replied: \""Do you mean the bowler or the ball?\"" An unorthodox left-arm spin delivery (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a right-handed batsman) is known as a \""chinaman\"" as a result. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded Test match player to bowl unorthodox left-arm spin – that is believed to be Charles Llewellyn of South Africa. Achong played in six Test matches for the West Indies against the English cricket team from 1930 to 1935, three in the West Indies and three in the 1933 tour of England. In all, Achong took eight Test wickets at a bowling average of 47.25, but his Test figures belie his much greater success at regional level in the West Indies between 1929–30 and 1934–35. In the final of the Inter-Colonial Tournament of 1931–32, he took 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to bowl Trinidad to victory over British Guiana. He [[married]] during the 1933 tour of England and settled in [[Manchester]]. After his last Test [[match]], he continued to [[play]] [[cricket]] for [[several]] [[clubs]] in the [[Lancashire]] [[Leagues]] until [[1951]], taking over 1,000 [[wickets]], including 10 in an innings for [[Burnley]] against Todmorden in 1945. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.

"Alan Dicks (born 29 August 1934) is an English retired footballer and football manager. He managed Bristol City for thirteen years and managed clubs in four countries on three continents. Born in London, he signed for Chelsea at the age of 17, though his playing time in the first team was limited to 35 matches in six years, during this time he completed his two years national service with the RAF and so only played one game in Chelsea's 1954–55 championship season. In 1958 he moved to Southend United, and in 1962 joined Coventry City as assistant manager/coach under Jimmy Hill. In 1967 Hill recommended him for the vacant manager's job at Bristol City. He took the job at the age of just 33, and held it for thirteen years. In that time he consolidated City's position in the Second Division, and eventually, in 1976, led them to [[promotion]] to the [[First]] [[Division]] – then English football's [[top]] flight. During his spell as manager the club also made the semi-finals of the 1971 League [[Cup]] and won the 1978 Anglo-Scottish Cup. Dicks remained as manager throughout City's four-year stay in Division 1, but [[relegation]] and a [[poor]] start to the [[following]] season saw him leave in October 1980. Subsequently, City suffered three relegations in as [[many]] [[years]].

"[[George]] Briscoe [[Kerferd]] ([[21]] January 1831 – 31 December [[1889]]), Australian colonial [[politician]], was the [[10th]] Premier of Victoria. Kerferd was [[born]] in Liverpool, the [[son]] of G. B. Kerferd, a merchant (or Joseph Kerferd, a bookkeeper, and his wife Rachel, née Blundell) Kerferd was educated at the Collegiate Institute, Liverpool, with intentions of studying law; however circumstances led him to enter his father's business. Kerferd emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with plans to open a branch of the family business, but this did not eventuate. After trying his luck as a gold miner at Bendigo, he settled in Beechworth and became a brewer and wine merchant. He was mayor of Beechworth 1863-64 and three other occasions. In [[1853]] he married Ann Martindale, with whom he had ten children. Kerferd was admitted to the Melbourne bar in 1867 but did not practise as a lawyer. Kerferd was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the Ovens in November [[1864]], and represented the area continuously until February 1886. He began studying law in 1864 and was Minister for Mines and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works in the government of James McCulloch 1868, and Solicitor-General 1872-1874 and Attorney-General in 1874 in the government of James Francis. When the Francis government was defeated in July 1874 Kerferd succeeded him at the head of a new conservative ministry. [[Kerferd's]] Treasurer, James Service, was, like most colonial conservatives, a convinced [[free]] trader, and the government's 1875 budget proposed repealing the tariffs imposed by [[Charles]] [[Gavan]] Duffy's liberal government, and replacing the lost revenue with a land tax and a tax on beer and [[spirits]].

"[[Athanasios]] [[John]] [[Traicos]] ([[born]] [[17]] [[May]] [[1947]]) is a former cricketer who represented [[South]] Africa and Zimbabwe at international level. He was primarily an off spin bowler, and is [[one]] of a small number of cricketers to have played at the highest level for more than [[one]] country. Traicos was born in [[Zagazig]], Egypt in 1947 where his father [[Tryphon]] worked in the family business. He is of Greek descent, his father having been born in Lemnos, Greece and his maternal grandmother in [[Kalymnos]], also in [[Greece]]. In September 1948 the family moved to what was then Fort Victoria in Southern [[Rhodesia]]. As a child he was known as \""Naso\"", a contraction of his name \""[[Athanasios]]\"", but when he started university he adopted the name \""John\"". Traicos grew up in Rhodesia and played for that country, which at the time was regarded as a \""province\"" within the South African domestic [[cricket]] [[setup]]. While a student at the University of [[Natal]] he benefited from being coached by Trevor Goddard making his [[first-class]] [[debut]] on 24 June 1967 when he represented South African Universities against Cambridge University, taking 5–54 in the first innings. He represented the South African Universities team on two more occasions before making his Rhodesia debut on 27 January 1968. He made his Test match debut for South Africa against Australia at Durban in February 1970 while still a student, having been selected at the request of the South African captain Ali [[Bacher]]. He took four catches and three wickets in his debut Test. However, after his three appearances in this series, South Africa were banned from international cricket because of apartheid. Traicos continued to play for Rhodesia, and after the country was renamed in 1980 represented Zimbabwe in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 ICC Trophy tournaments. He also played for Zimbabwe in the 1983 Cricket World Cup, and was an important part of the side which inflicted a shock defeat on Australia. Zimbabwe were raised to Test status in 1992, and Traicos was selected for the country's inaugural Test match, at Harare Sports Club against India. This appearance came a record 22 years and 222 days after his previous Test appearance, and he repaid the selectors' decision with his best Test bowling figures of 5/86. He played three more Tests for Zimbabwe, and his final appearance came at the age of [[45]] [[years]] and [[304]] [[days]], making him the oldest Test player since Miran Bux 38 years earlier, and the twelfth oldest of all time. He would have been even further up the list had he been available for selection for the following year's tour of Pakistan, but Traicos' business commitments prevented this.

"[[The]] [[Usoi]] [[Dam]] is a natural [[landslide]] dam along the [[Murghab]] River in Tajikistan. At 567 metres (1,860 ft) high, it is the tallest dam in the world, either natural or [[man-made]].

It is [[named]] after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide.

The alliance, however, failed to achieve its self-stated goal to attain an absolute majority on its own. Newly-formed Podemos (Spanish for \""We can\""), Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV), United and Alternative Left (EUiA) and Equo stood together under the Catalunya Sí que es Pot (CSQP) label, a second novel electoral grouping formed for this election. The alliance was modeled after the Barcelona en Comú platform that won the 2015 Barcelona election, but it failed to garner the decisive support of the city's popular mayor Ada Colau and achieved a poor performance. Citizens (C's) benefited from its anti-independence stance and climbed to second place [[haead]] of a declining Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC), which scored a new historical low for the third election in a row. The People's Party of Catalonia (PPC) suffered from its national counterpart decline and scored its worst [[reuslt]] since 1992, whereas the left-wing Popular Unity Candidacy saw a strong performance which allowed it to hold the key to government formation with JxSí.",0.0023326873779296875,0.9967774748802185,5,0,5,298,"Successful"

The white-backed vulture is a typical vulture, with only down feathers on the head and neck, very broad wings and short tail feathers. It has a white [[eck]] [[rff]]. The adult’s [[whztish]] back contrasts with the otherwise [[daOk]] plumage. Juveniles are largely dark. This is a medium-sized vulture; its body mass is 4.2 to 7.2 kilograms (9.3–15.9 lb), it is 78 to 98 cm (31 to 39 in) long and has a 1.96 to 2.[[5]] m (6 to 7 ft) [[winsgpan]]. Like other vultures it is a scavenger, feeding mostly from carcasses of animals which it finds by soaring over savannah. It also takes [[craps]] from human [[hwbitations]]. It often moves in flocks. It breeds in trees on the savannah of west and east Africa, laying one egg. [[Thl]] [[populBtion]] is mostly [[rzsident]].",0.0017716288566589355,0.0018613338470458984,3,3,3,313,"Failed"

The All-Ireland final between Clare and Kilkenny was the first championship meeting between the two sides. Kilkenny were hoping to retain the title and claim their 11th championship. Clare were hoping to win their first All-Ireland title. Kilkenny started the brighter and scored first through Mark Kelly who tapped over with just a minute on the clock. Clare signalled their intent from that point on and raced into a 0-3 to 0-2 lead with Colin Ryan and Caimin Morey both finding their range early on. Clare built on that early lead and were in control for most of the opening half, with the influential Ryan claiming four further points before the interval to help his side to an 0-8 0-6 half-time lead. Kilkenny charged out of the [[blocks]] in the second half, putting real pressure on Clare by hitting three [[points]] without answer from Richie Hogan, James Nolan and Colin Fennelly. With fifteen minutes remaining in the [[match]] Kilkenny were ahead by 0-12 to 0-10. Clare dug deep to [[rally]] late on, outscoring the Cats by five [[points]] to two with John Conlon claiming two superb points to help his side to their first major silverware [[since]] winning the minor and senior All-Ireland double in 1997. Clare's All-Ireland victory was their very first. They became the eighth team to win the All-Ireland title and put them in joint sixth position with Wexford and Waterford on the all-time roll of honour.

"Theophilus \""Theo\"" Verster ([[born]] January 14, [[1975]]) is a South African former [[swimmer]], who specialized in butterfly and in individual medley events. He won three medals at the 1999 [[All-Africa]] Games, and later represented South Africa at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He also held an African record of 55.04 from the 2002 Telkom International Sprint Challenge that defeated Terence Parkin for a top finish and sliced off Brendon [[Dedekind's]] standard by 0.37 of a second. During his sporting career, Verster trained full-time for the Pietermaritzburg Seals Swim Club under his personal coach Wayne [[Riddin]]. Verster ascended to prominence in the global scene at the 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Sydney, placing seventh each in the 100 m butterfly (54.[[28]]) and 200 m individual medley (2:04.24). On that same year, at the All-Africa Games in [[Johannesburg]], Verster established meet records to claim two golds each in the 200 m butterfly (2:04.[[69]]) and in the 200 m individual medley (2:04.[[10]]). In the 100 m butterfly, he was [[upstaged]] by teammate Kelly on a head-to-head race, ending up only with a silver in 54.[[75]]. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Verster built a monstrous program of four swimming events. He posted FINA [[A-standards]] of 53.86 (100 m butterfly), 2:[[01]].[[63]] (200 m butterfly), and 2:03.11 (200 m individual medley) from the South African Championships in Johannesburg. On the third day of the Games, [[Verster]] placed twenty-sixth in the 200 m butterfly. Swimming in heat three, he picked up a fourth seed by almost a full body length behind winner Vladan [[Marković]] of Yugoslavia in 2:00.[[90]]. Two days [[later]], in the 200 m individual [[medley]], [[Verster]] finished twentieth in 2:[[03]].64, nearly a small fraction of a second outside the semifinal field. In his final individual event, 100 m butterfly, Verster posted a time of 53.95 from heat five, but missed again the semifinals by 0.14 of a second with an eighteenth-place effort. Verster also teamed up with Simon Thirsk, Brett Petersen, and Nicholas [[Folker]] in the 4 × 100 m [[medley]] relay. Swimming a butterfly leg in heat two, Verster recorded a split of 53.52, a national record, but the South Africans finished the race in fourth place and thirteenth overall with a final time of 3:42.44. Verster also sought his entry bid for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, but finished fourth in the 100 m butterfly (54.82) at the South African Championships, handing over to his teammate Eugene Botes. Shortly after the trials, Verster announced his retirement from swimming.
