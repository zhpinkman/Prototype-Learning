"[[On]] 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","[[For]] 20 [[Juli]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

"Russells Hall [[Hospital]] is an NHS general [[hospital]] located in [[Dudley]], West Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group NHS [[Foundation]] Trust. The [[hospital]] is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the hospital opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the completion of the expanded hospital and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley town centre - Kingswinford Road - was widened into a dual carriageway in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in 1999. Cricketer Ian Botham, famous for his charity work, opened a state of the art leukaemia unit at the hospital in 1998.

She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[misleading]] [[peculiarities]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was [[implemented]] in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.",0.011315882205963135,0.5801172256469727,0,1,0,294,"Successful"
"\""Space [[Invaders]]\"" is a [[song]] by Australian songwriters Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown, recording under the band name Player One (commonly stylised as Player [1]) in 1979.

It was, however, influential in the history of dance music, being sampled by Jesse Saunders for the bassline of what is commonly held to be the first Chicago house music record, \""On and On\"" (1984).

"3070 Aitken, provisional designation 1949 GK, is a stony [[Flora]] [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] [[belt]], about 4 [[kilometers]] in [[diameter]]. [[It]] was [[discovered]] on 4 April 1949, by the U.S. Indiana Asteroid Program of Indiana University at Goethe Link Observatory in Brooklyn. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony [[asteroids]] in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,279 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The used first precovery was taken at Turku Observatory in 1942, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery. However, the asteroid was already imaged in 1907, at Taunton in Massachusetts (803). A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory in November 2010. The light-curve gave a rotation period of 6.3965±0.0026 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.38 in magnitude (U=2). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 3.9 kilometers. The minor planet was named for of American astronomer Robert Grant Aitken (1864–1951), who was the 4th director of the Lick Observatory from 1930 to 1935, successor of director William Campbell, after whom the minor planet 2751 Campbell was named. Aitken became a well known expert on double stars and, in 1932, published the New General Catalogue of Double Stars Within 120° of the North Pole, He is also known for his book The Binary Stars that was first published in 1918.

"(For their \""best of\"" album, see The Best of Judas Priest: Living After Midnight.) \""Living After Midnight\"" is a [[song]] by British heavy metal band Judas Priest. [[It]] was originally featured on their 1980 album British Steel, which was their first gold [[album]] in the United States selling more than 500,000 [[copies]] (and eventually went platinum for selling at least 1 million). The song speaks to the hedonistic, rebellious spirit of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is among the band's most popular songs. On live performances, the line, \""I took the city 'bout one a.m.\"", is sometimes changed to the particular city or venue the band is performing. For example, on the DVD Rising in the East, lead vocalist Rob Halford sings, \""I took the Budokan 'bout one a.m.\"", in reference to the stadium in Tokyo, Japan, that hosted the concert. On the Westwood One recordings from the 1983 US Festival Halford recites, \""I took some acid about 1 a.m....\"" The music video, directed by Julien Temple and shot live at the Sheffield City Hall, begins with drummer Dave Holland playing an invisible drum kit. During the guitar solo, fans on the front row play along with their cardboard guitars (which were the prominent fan symbols of the new wave of British heavy metal movement). This song has been covered by The Donnas on their album The Donnas Turn 21 (2001), by Phil Gnarly and the Tough Guys at a house party in Madison, by Saul Blanch on the tribute album Acero Argentino: Tributo a Judas Priest (2006), by L.A. Guns on Hell Bent Forever: A Tribute to Judas Priest (2008) and by Iron Savior as a bonus track on the Japanese release of their Condition Red (2002) album.

[[He]] was originally featured on their 1980 album British Steel, which was their first gold [[registrations]] in the United States selling more than 500,000 [[copying]] (and eventually went platinum for selling at least 1 million). The song speaks to the hedonistic, rebellious spirit of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is among the band's most popular songs. On live performances, the line, \""I took the city 'bout one a.m.\"", is sometimes changed to the particular city or venue the band is performing. For example, on the DVD Rising in the East, lead vocalist Rob Halford sings, \""I took the Budokan 'bout one a.m.\"", in reference to the stadium in Tokyo, Japan, that hosted the concert. On the Westwood One recordings from the 1983 US Festival Halford recites, \""I took some acid about 1 a.m....\"" The music video, directed by Julien Temple and shot live at the Sheffield City Hall, begins with drummer Dave Holland playing an invisible drum kit. During the guitar solo, fans on the front row play along with their cardboard guitars (which were the prominent fan symbols of the new wave of British heavy metal movement). This song has been covered by The Donnas on their album The Donnas Turn 21 (2001), by Phil Gnarly and the Tough Guys at a house party in Madison, by Saul Blanch on the tribute album Acero Argentino: Tributo a Judas Priest (2006), by L.A.

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] [[belt]], approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. [[It]] was [[discovered]] by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of [[asteroids]] in the Solar System. The asteroid [[orbits]] the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first [[observation]] was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years [[prior]] to its [[discovery]]. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric [[observations]] by U.S. [[astronomer]] Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. [[It]] gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and [[calculates]] a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute [[magnitude]] of 13.7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out.

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in [[Easton]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United]] [[States]], [[founded]] in 1995 by [[Dan]] and [[Sue]] Weirback. The [[brewery]] is [[well]] [[known]] for its \""[[huge]] taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with [[QUAD]] clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by [[volume]]. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a [[pioneer]] of aging [[beer]] in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, [[Blithering]] Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into [[Blasphemy]]. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the [[brewery]] had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011.

The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the [[keg]] had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011. As a result, brewing capacity was expanded from 10,000 to 30,000 barrels per year in 2012.",0.005984961986541748,0.7829182147979736,0,3,0,704,"Successful"

"The Jerusalem Light Rail (Hebrew: הרכבת הקלה בירושלים‎‎, Ha-Rakevet ha-Kala bi-Rushalayim) is a light rail [[system]] in Jerusalem. Currently, the Red Line is the only one in operation, the first of several light rail lines planned in Jerusalem. Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it. The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem. After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011.

Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest. When completed in 2016, these will extend the line's length to 22.5 km. With a total estimated cost for the initial line of ₪3.8 billion (approx.

The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of all Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.
