[[His]] [[family]] moved to Connecticut when he was [[six]] [[years]] old. As a young man, he worked as a merchant in [[Savannah]], [[Georgia]]. In 1827 he relocated to [[New]] [[York]] City, where he was a [[commission]] [[agent]] engaged in the sale of gunpowder and other [[products]]. In 1837 he bought into a [[gunpowder]] [[production]] company that had been [[established]] two [[years]] earlier on the [[Scantic]] River in the town of [[Enfield]], [[Connecticut]]. [[He]] assumed sole ownership of the company in [[1843]]. The business was [[known]] thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the village that supported it [[became]] known as Hazardville. During the [[early]] years of the [[Civil]] [[War]], [[Col]]. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the [[Southern]] [[Cause]]. It was [[well]] known that he was a [[good]] friend of [[Confederate]] [[President]] [[Jefferson]] Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business [[relationships]]. Shortly before [[South]] [[Carolina]] seceded from the Union, it [[bought]] 80,000 lbs. of [[powder]] that was used to propel the [[first]] [[shots]] fired on Fort [[Sumter]]. [[In]] [[fact]], much of the powder in the [[Southern]] Arsenals at the outset of the war was manufactured by the [[Connecticut]] [[company]]. [[The]] rapidly increasing demand for [[powder]] [[products]] [[compelled]] Hazard to [[hurriedly]] expand their facilities to [[meet]] [[war]] time [[production]] [[needs]]. [[Soon]] Hazard Powder was supplying the [[Union]] Forces with 12,[[500]] lbs of powder a [[day]]. [[The]] mill at Hazardville was in [[operation]] 24 hours a day and produced 40% of all the [[gunpowder]] used during the [[Civil]] War by the [[Union]].

"[[Russells]] Hall [[Hospital]] is an [[NHS]] general [[hospital]] [[located]] in [[Dudley]], West Midlands, [[England]], run by [[The]] [[Dudley]] Group NHS [[Foundation]] [[Trust]]. [[The]] [[hospital]] is [[situated]] south-west of the town [[centre]] on the [[A4101]] road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the [[borough]]. [[It]] was [[first]] planned in the 1960s as a general [[hospital]] for [[Dudley]] and the surrounding area. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's [[hospitals]], and the general [[hospital]] buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March [[1984]], becoming fully operational in May that [[year]]. The new [[hospital]] included an accident and [[emergency]] unit to replace those at the Guest [[Hospital]] in Dudley and the Corbett [[Hospital]] in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest [[Hospital]]. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest [[hospitals]], as well as parts of the Corbett [[Hospital]]. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley [[Hospital]] would close [[completely]] and Corbett and [[Dudley]] [[Guest]] would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being [[expanded]] to [[include]] all of the borough's [[in-patient]] [[services]]. [[The]] [[first]] [[phases]] of the [[work]] were [[completed]] in [[2004]] and the expansion was [[completed]] during [[2005]], by which [[time]] Russells [[Hall]] had [[doubled]] in [[size]]. Much of the existing [[hospital]] was also refurbished. The Princess [[Royal]] opened the revamped [[hospital]] on [[22]] [[February]] [[2006]] ‚Äì [[22]] [[years]] after she had opened the original [[hospital]]. In preparation for the completion of the expanded [[hospital]] and inevitable [[rise]] in traffic, the main road towards Dudley town centre - Kingswinford Road - was widened into a dual carriageway in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in 1999. Cricketer Ian Botham, famous for his [[charity]] work, opened a state of the art leukaemia unit at the [[hospital]] in 1998. Pop star and actor Martin Kemp opened the hospital's new CT [[scanning]] suite in January 2006, a decade after he recovered from [[brain]] [[cancer]] with the help of pioneering [[treatment]].

"[[Naga]] the Serpent (ÁôΩËõá„ÅÆ„Éä„Éº„Ç¨ SƒÅpento no NƒÅga) is a [[fictional]] [[character]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990. She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (ÁôΩËõáJP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: „Ç∞„É¨„Ç§„Ç∑„Ç¢Ôºù„Ç¶„É´Ôºù„Éä„Éº„Ç¨Ôºù„Çª„Ç§„É´„Éº„É≥ Gureishia Uru NƒÅga Seir≈´n). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story.

She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (ÁôΩËõáJP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"".

The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse.

"[[AIA]] [[Group]] [[Limited]] [[known]] as [[AIA]] (Chinese: ÂèãÈÇ¶‰øùÈö™ÊéßËÇ°ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏) is the [[largest]] independent [[public]] [[listed]] [[pan-Asian]] [[life]] [[insurance]] group.

On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region.

"The King George VI [[Reservoir]] in [[England]] lies to the south of Stanwellmoor [[near]] [[Stanwell]] and [[Heathrow]].

[[It]] [[gave]] a [[long]] rotation [[period]] of 105.[[7]]¬±[[0]].1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in [[magnitude]] ([[U]]=[[3-]]).

"[[In]] [[1303]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

"The [[River]] [[Witham]] is a [[river]] almost entirely in the [[county]] of [[Lincolnshire]] in the [[east]] of England. [[It]] [[rises]] [[south]] of Grantham [[close]] to [[South]] [[Witham]] at SK8818, [[passes]] Lincoln at SK9771 and at [[Boston]], [[TF3244]], [[flows]] into The Haven, a [[tidal]] [[arm]] of The [[Wash]], near [[RSPB]] [[Frampton]] Marsh. The [[name]] \""[[Witham]]\"" seems to be [[extremely]] old and of [[unknown]] [[origin]]. [[Archaeological]] and [[documentary]] evidence [[shows]] the [[importance]] of the [[Witham]] as a navigation from the [[Iron]] [[Age]] [[onwards]]. From [[Roman]] [[times]] it was navigable to Lincoln, from where the [[Fossdyke]] was [[constructed]] to [[link]] it to the [[River]] [[Trent]]. [[The]] [[mouth]] of the [[river]] [[moved]] in [[1014]] following [[severe]] [[flooding]], and [[Boston]] became [[important]] as a [[port]]. From [[1142]] onwards, sluices were constructed to [[prevent]] [[flooding]] by the sea, and this culminated in the Great [[Sluice]], which was constructed in 1766. It [[maintained]] [[river]] [[levels]] above [[Boston]], and helped to scour the [[channel]] below it. The [[land]] through which the [[lower]] river runs has been the [[subject]] of much [[land]] [[drainage]], and many [[drains]] are [[connected]] to the [[Witham]] by flood [[doors]], which [[block]] them off if river [[levels]] rise [[rapidly]]. [[The]] [[river]] is navigable from Brayford Pool in Lincoln to [[Boston]]. Its [[locks]] are at Lincoln, Bardney and the [[Grand]]/Great Sluice.

[[The]] original [[tower]] was an 80 [[ft]] [[structure]] [[erected]] in [[1930]]. The [[successor]], [[currently]] standing, is 100 [[ft]] [[high]] and was abandoned in the [[1960s]].

[[Located]] between [[Tower]] [[Peak]] and the [[North]] Peak, the [[Ishpatina]] Canyon is one of the deepest in Ontario. The elevation of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level. The canyon is nearly twice as deep as Ouimet Canyon, often considered Ontario's deepest. However, the more gradual descent into the canyon hides the fact.

The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger [[route]] in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The [[line]] is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The [[line]] has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains. Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h). The WCML has a significantly higher number of curves than most other main lines in Britain, hence the requirement for tilting operation for higher speeds.","The West Coast Main [[L—ñne]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[rouùöùe]] in the United Kingdom.

In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The [[li’∏e]] is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The [[bloodline]] has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains. Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h). The WCML has a significantly higher number of curves than most other main lines in Britain, hence the requirement for tilting operation for higher speeds.",0.02875453233718872,0.5641274452209473,2,0,2,282,"Successful"

As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school.

The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake [[Hopatcong]] in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal.

The \""scull\"" [[portion]] means that the rower uses [[two]] [[oars]], one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with [[sweep]] rowing in which each rower has [[one]] oar and rows on only [[one]] side (not feasible for [[singles]] [[events]]). [[The]] [[competition]] consists of [[multiple]] [[rounds]]. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were [[given]] letters with those nearer to the beginning of the [[alphabet]] meaning a [[better]] [[ranking]]. Semifinals were [[named]] based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having [[two]] [[possible]] [[finals]]. During the first [[round]] [[six]] heats were [[held]]. [[The]] [[winning]] boat in each [[heat]] advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the [[repechages]].

For each [[semifinal]] race, the [[top]] [[three]] [[boats]] moved on to the better of the [[two]] finals, while the [[bottom]] [[three]] [[boats]] went to the lesser of the [[two]] [[finals]] [[possible]]. For example, a [[second-place]] finish in an [[A]]/B [[semifinal]] [[would]] result in advancement to the [[A]] [[final]]. [[The]] fourth and [[final]] round was the [[Finals]]. [[Each]] [[final]] determined a set of [[rankings]]. [[The]] [[A]] [[final]] determined the [[medals]], along with the rest of the places through [[6th]]. [[The]] [[B]] [[final]] [[gave]] rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on.

Other locations include in front of the Brunswick Mechanics Institute and in Victoria Street Mall at Coburg. In 2013 Koalas made from gray plastic bags by Coburg resident and artist Aaron James McGarry were tied up into eucalypt trees in Victoria Street Mall at Coburg. McGarry commented, \""The idea was to use an iconic native animal. They're one of the many flora and fauna plastic bags have an impact on. It's an environmental piece that looks at our impact as consumers.\"" In 2016 Moreland City Councillor and Mayor Samantha Ratnam said that MoreArt is significant in helping to bring the community together and in enhancing the historic railway station buildings. ‚ÄúPublic art increases vibrancy and social cohesion in the community, economically it benefits the community by attracting more people, and importantly, by activating a space, it can change the perception of a space and the way it‚Äôs used,‚Äù Councillor Ratnam said. The public art show is supported by the City of Moreland.",0.0056098103523254395,0.8637361526489258,5,2,5,265,"Successful"

"The [[Usoi]] [[Dam]] is a [[natural]] [[landslide]] [[dam]] along the [[Murghab]] [[River]] in Tajikistan. At [[567]] [[metres]] (1,[[860]] [[ft]]) high, it is the tallest [[dam]] in the world, [[either]] [[natural]] or man-made. [[The]] [[dam]] was created on February 18, 1911, when the [[7]].4-Ms Sarez earthquake [[caused]] a massive landslide that [[blocked]] the [[flow]] of the river. The [[dam]] is formed of [[approximately]] 2 cubic [[kilometres]] (0.48 [[cu]] mi) of rock dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of the Murghab, which cuts from east to west through the high and [[rough]] Pamir Mountains. It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the [[1911]] landslide. [[The]] [[dam]] rises to a height of 500 to 700 [[metres]] (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the [[original]] [[valley]] floor.
