"St. Gabriel's is a Roman Catholic [[parish]] of the Roman Catholic [[Archdiocese]] of New York, located in southern end of the city of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York. This [[parish]] was founded in 1893 by Mrs. Adrian Iselin and family, longtime residents of New Rochelle. The church was a memorial given by Mrs. Adrian Iselin and endowed by her for the Catholics of New Rochelle. St. Gabriel's was consecrated on May 28, 1893 by Michael Corrigan, then the Archbishop of New York. The buildings of the parish are distinctly Norman-English in design. The [[church]] was built of blue granite and limestone with a steeply pitched red tile roof, and two towers with a clock and chimes. The adjacent rectory house was built in a corresponding style.The interior features salmon colored brick walls, arched hardwood paneled ceilings and mosaic floors. The decoration of the chancel walls is in old gold and is a near perfect reproduction of the chancel of the San Marco Cathedral in Venice. The three chancel windows were designed by Franz Mayer & Co. and represent \""the Saviour\"", \""St. Francis de Sales\"" and \""St. Margaret of Scotland\"". The intricately carved white marble altar is a memorial to Fannie G. Iselin. St. Paul's features 17 impressive stained-glass windows crafted by Louis Comfort Tiffany Studios, The Gorham Company, Franz Mayer & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The Tiffany windows include \""The Education Of The Virgin\"", \""The Annunciation\"", \""The Marriage Of Joseph And Mary\"" and \""The Baptism of Jesus\"". The complete set of memorial windows were gifts of the seven Iselin children in honor of their mother. At the time of its construction, St. Gabriel's was one of the most costly houses of [[worship]] in the region.

The church was a memorial given by Mrs. Adrian Iselin and endowed by her for the Catholics of New Rochelle. St. Gabriel's was consecrated on May 28, 1893 by Michael Corrigan, then the Archbishop of New York. The buildings of the parish are distinctly Norman-English in design. The [[ecclesiastical]] was built of blue granite and limestone with a steeply pitched red tile roof, and two towers with a clock and chimes. The adjacent rectory house was built in a corresponding style.The interior features salmon colored brick walls, arched hardwood paneled ceilings and mosaic floors. The decoration of the chancel walls is in old gold and is a near perfect reproduction of the chancel of the San Marco Cathedral in Venice. The three chancel windows were designed by Franz Mayer & Co. and represent \""the Saviour\"", \""St. Francis de Sales\"" and \""St. Margaret of Scotland\"". The intricately carved white marble altar is a memorial to Fannie G. Iselin. St. Paul's features 17 impressive stained-glass windows crafted by Louis Comfort Tiffany Studios, The Gorham Company, Franz Mayer & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The Tiffany windows include \""The Education Of The Virgin\"", \""The Annunciation\"", \""The Marriage Of Joseph And Mary\"" and \""The Baptism of Jesus\"".

"Russells [[Hall]] [[Hospital]] is an NHS [[general]] [[hospital]] [[located]] in Dudley, [[West]] [[Midlands]], [[England]], run by [[The]] [[Dudley]] Group NHS [[Foundation]] Trust.

[[Around]] this [[time]], the NHS first [[began]] to [[consider]] the [[closure]] of [[Dudley]] Guest Hospital. [[In]] 1992, [[plans]] were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as [[part]] of [[plans]] to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as [[well]] as parts of the [[Corbett]] Hospital.

They were signed to Smallman Records and in late-2006 released their debut album Stallone. They continued to tour and in March 2007, released their second album Turf Wars. The [[band]] [[consisted]] of Nick Leadlay (vocals, formerly of the band Playboy Assassin), Kenny Lush (guitar, formerly of The Retreads), Stuart McKillop (guitar and vocals, formerly of End This Week With Knives), Erik Nielsen (bass), and Dan Donald (drums). The band's sound is characterized by melodic vocals combined with pop-punk guitar riffs and basslines but with a more hardcore feel. Their name is a reference to a robotic fish from the Family Guy episode \""A Fish Out of Water\"". Past members include drummer J.J. Heath and bass player Dana W.R. Edwards who now play in Vancouver's \""Carpenter\"". J.J. is also punk legends DOA's new drummer. Jarrod Mochenross and Tom Hillifer also filled in on bass at certain points in time. In November 2008, Leadlay officially announced their indefinite hiatus via a Myspace blog: \""Is dmouth over? yes and no..... yes in the sense right now we aren't playing shows/touring. we may not tour for a long time if ever again to be honest. will we ever play a show again? i don't know. the more time that passes the more i hope we do. i really would love to roll out to LA and SF and play some shows like the old days.

[[Ils]] started around early 2004 quickly building a solid reputation by touring with bands such as Moneen and SNFU. They were signed to Smallman Records and in late-2006 released their debut album Stallone. They continued to tour and in March 2007, released their second album Turf Wars. The [[strip]] [[composed]] of Nick Leadlay (vocals, formerly of the band Playboy Assassin), Kenny Lush (guitar, formerly of The Retreads), Stuart McKillop (guitar and vocals, formerly of End This Week With Knives), Erik Nielsen (bass), and Dan Donald (drums). The band's sound is characterized by melodic vocals combined with pop-punk guitar riffs and basslines but with a more hardcore feel. Their name is a reference to a robotic fish from the Family Guy episode \""A Fish Out of Water\"". Past members include drummer J.J. Heath and bass player Dana W.R. Edwards who now play in Vancouver's \""Carpenter\"". J.J. is also punk legends DOA's new drummer. Jarrod Mochenross and Tom Hillifer also filled in on bass at certain points in time. In November 2008, Leadlay officially announced their indefinite hiatus via a Myspace blog: \""Is dmouth over? yes and no..... yes in the sense right now we aren't playing shows/touring. we may not tour for a long time if ever again to be honest. will we ever play a show again? i don't know. the more time that passes the more i hope we do. i really would love to roll out to LA and SF and play some shows like the old days. Hell lets bring it back to where we started and get Heads Up to play a back yard show with us in Pomona!!! at this point it's hard to tell. The one thing that is a definite possibuilty though is [[rendering]] a new record. I know that may not be enough for some of you and i understand that. But at this point for heath reasons for myself as well as some of the other members of dmouth it may be all we can offer. I miss making music and that's why we all start bands anyway is to make songs we are stoked on.\"" [sic] The band says there is an album's worth of material demoed. Stu has since been involved in a number of [[plans]] and continues to record bands. Dan has also continued playing in other bands and is currently drumming for Winnipeg, MB based pop punk band, Elder Abuse. Kenny has become a professional wrestler and has toured Japan and Korea numerous times competing.

Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very [[por]] [[ous]] icy body.

"([[148209]]) 2000 CR105, [[also]] [[written]] as ([[148209]]) 2000 CR105, is the [[tenth-most-distant]] known [[object]] in the [[Solar]] System as of 2015. Considered a detached object, it [[orbits]] the Sun in a [[highly]] eccentric [[orbit]] every 3305 years at an average [[distance]] of 222 [[astronomical]] [[units]] ([[AU]]). [[Mike]] Brown's website lists it as a possible [[dwarf]] [[planet]] with a diameter of 328 [[kilometres]] (204 mi) [[based]] on an [[assumed]] [[albedo]] of 0.04. The [[albedo]] is expected to be [[low]] because the [[object]] has a [[blue]] (neutral) color. [[However]], if the albedo is [[higher]], the [[object]] could [[easily]] be [[half]] that [[size]]. (148209) 2000 [[CR105]] and Sedna differ from scattered-disc objects in that they are not within the gravitational [[influence]] of the planet Neptune [[even]] at their perihelion [[distances]] ([[closest]] approaches to the Sun).

Before then, the more [[popular]] Maple [[Mountain]] was thought to be [[higher]]. [[The]] [[ridge]] [[lies]] in [[Lady]] Evelyn-Smoothwater [[Provincial]] [[Park]]. Due to its [[remote]] location, [[Ishpatina]] Ridge is a challenge to [[reach]]. [[The]] closest [[major]] [[highway]], Highway 560, is more than 30 km north. There are a few logging [[roads]] and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to [[travel]] in [[poor]] weather. [[The]] most [[popular]] approach [[route]] to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage [[via]] a logging road to the south out of the [[town]] of Capreol north of Sudbury. [[While]] a [[northern]] route exists (out of [[Gowganda]], the nearest community), there are numerous portages [[making]] it [[particularly]] onerous. This [[route]] has [[traditionally]] been used for a winter-time [[approach]] by [[ski]]/snowshoe. [[Historically]], a fire [[tower]] atop the [[ridge]] was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the [[site]] by float [[plane]]. [[The]] [[name]] \""Ishpatina\"" comes from an Ojibwe language [[word]] [[ishpadinaa]], [[meaning]] \""[[high]] place/ridge\"". [[The]] [[city]] of Ishpeming, [[Michigan]], in Marquette [[County]], and [[Spadina]] [[Avenue]] in Toronto, Ontario derive their names from the same [[word]].

[[An]] abandoned firetower, often referred to as the [[Ellis]] Tower, is still standing on the highest section of the [[Ridge]] (left). The [[original]] [[tower]] was an 80 ft [[structure]] [[erected]] in 1930. [[The]] successor, [[currently]] standing, is 100 ft [[high]] and was abandoned in the 1960s. The towerman would have [[resided]] in a [[cabin]] on the [[shore]] of [[Scarecrow]] Lake and would have hiked a 3.5 km [[trail]] daily [[taking]] approximately two hours to summit and a little over one hour to descend again. Located between Tower Peak and the North Peak, the Ishpatina Canyon is one of the deepest in Ontario. The elevation of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level. The canyon is nearly twice as deep as Ouimet Canyon, often considered Ontario's deepest. However, the more gradual descent into the canyon hides the fact. The ridge was featured on an interactive web series called The Peakbaggers.","[[Ishpatna]] [[Crete]] is the [[highesùöù]] [[poinùöù]] of [[l]] [[and]] in the [[Canadiens]] province of Ontario, at an [[estimation]] 693 m (2,[[24]] ft) above [[hoi]] [[grades]].

"The West Coast Main [[Line]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[route]] in the United Kingdom. It is Britain's most important rail backbone in terms of population served. The route links Greater London, the West Midlands, the North West, North Wales and the Central Belt of Scotland. The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger route in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains. Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h). The WCML has a significantly higher number of curves than most other main lines in Britain, hence the requirement for tilting operation for higher speeds.","The West Coast Main [[Lin–µ]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[‚≤Öoute]] in the United Kingdom.

Love is a Strange and Different Thing) is a fictional [[manga]] written and [[illustrated]] by Japanese author Taishi Za≈ç (also known for her sh≈çjo works under the name Mikiyo Tsuda) in 2002. The story focuses on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.

[[Born]] to a [[barrister]] and his [[wife]], who had both [[died]] by the time he was 5, Hale was [[raised]] by his father's [[relative]], a [[strict]] Puritan, and [[inherited]] his [[faith]]. In [[1626]] he matriculated at [[Magdalen]] Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), [[intending]] to [[become]] a priest, but after a series of distractions was [[persuaded]] to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a [[Serjeant-at-Law]] in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he [[joined]] Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the [[Bar]] on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, [[Hale]] [[represented]] a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the [[English]] [[Civil]] [[War]], including Thomas [[Wentworth]] and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to [[represent]] [[Charles]] I at his state trial, and [[conceived]] the [[defence]] Charles [[used]]. Despite the [[Royalist]] [[loss]], Hale's [[reputation]] for integrity and his political [[neutrality]] saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was [[made]] Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. [[Following]] the Commission's [[dissolution]], [[Oliver]] Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas.

Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law.

Bruce [[investigated]] [[medical]] practices in the [[army]] and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical [[Service]] which urged a complete [[reorganization]] of the [[medical]] [[corps]]. Few of his recommendations for [[general]] reorganization were immediately [[feasible]] from the [[military]] and [[economic]] points-of-view, and the [[manner]] of his [[appointment]] was protested by [[Sir]] William Osler as an affront to the [[medical]] [[profession]]. Bruce's report was [[disowned]] by the [[government]] at the [[time]] and he was [[dismissed]] from his [[duties]], while his [[conservative]] [[patron]], [[Hughes]], was [[obliged]] to resign. In 1919, [[Bruce]] [[published]] [[Politics]] and the [[Canadian]] [[Army]] Medical [[Corps]], [[criticizing]] the [[government]] for its [[actions]] but [[avoiding]] any [[specific]] denunciation of [[Hughes]].

[[In]] 1920, [[Bruce]] [[purchased]] a [[farm]] on [[Bayview]] [[Avenue]] overlooking the [[Don]] Valley and [[built]] a [[Tudor-style]] [[mansion]] which he [[named]] [[Annandale]]. [[In]] 1932, he was appointed [[Lieutenant]] [[Governor]] of [[Ontario]] by [[R]].B. [[Bennett]] for a [[term]] that lasted until [[1937]]. He [[often]] verbally [[clashed]] with new [[Ontario]] Premier [[Mitch]] Hepburn who [[attempted]] to [[curtail]] the extravagance of the vice-regal [[office]] in the face of the Great [[Depression]]. The lieutenant-governor's [[official]] [[residence]], Chorley Park, was closed by the [[Hepburn]] [[government]] at the [[end]] of Bruce's [[term]] on the pretext of cutting [[costs]]. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, [[Bruce]] [[took]] the [[unusual]] step of [[entering]] [[politics]] [[following]] his term as the King's representative. [[Following]] the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

"[[George]] [[Briscoe]] [[Kerferd]] ([[21]] [[January]] 1831 ‚Äì 31 [[December]] [[1889]]), [[Australian]] [[colonial]] [[politician]], was the [[10th]] Premier of [[Victoria]]. Kerferd was born in Liverpool, the son of G. [[B]]. Kerferd, a merchant (or [[Joseph]] Kerferd, a bookkeeper, and his [[wife]] Rachel, n√©e [[Blundell]]) Kerferd was educated at the [[Collegiate]] Institute, Liverpool, with intentions of [[studying]] [[law]]; however [[circumstances]] led him to enter his [[father's]] [[business]]. Kerferd emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with plans to open a branch of the [[family]] business, but this did not [[eventuate]].

When the Francis [[government]] was [[defeated]] in [[July]] 1874 Kerferd succeeded him at the head of a new [[conservative]] [[ministry]].
