"St. [[Gabriel's]] is a Roman Catholic [[parish]] of the Roman Catholic [[Archdiocese]] of New York, located in southern end of the city of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York. This parish was founded in 1893 by Mrs. Adrian Iselin and family, longtime residents of New Rochelle. The [[church]] was a memorial given by Mrs. Adrian Iselin and endowed by her for the Catholics of New Rochelle. St. Gabriel's was consecrated on May 28, 1893 by Michael Corrigan, then the Archbishop of New York. The buildings of the parish are distinctly Norman-English in design. The church was built of blue granite and limestone with a steeply pitched red tile roof, and two towers with a clock and chimes. The adjacent rectory house was built in a corresponding style.The interior features salmon colored brick walls, arched hardwood paneled ceilings and mosaic floors. The decoration of the chancel walls is in old gold and is a near perfect reproduction of the chancel of the San Marco Cathedral in Venice. The three chancel windows were designed by Franz Mayer & Co. and represent \""the Saviour\"", \""St. Francis de Sales\"" and \""St. Margaret of Scotland\"". The intricately carved white marble altar is a memorial to Fannie G. Iselin. St. Paul's features 17 impressive stained-glass windows crafted by Louis Comfort Tiffany Studios, The Gorham Company, Franz Mayer & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The Tiffany windows include \""The Education Of The Virgin\"", \""The Annunciation\"", \""The Marriage Of Joseph And Mary\"" and \""The Baptism of Jesus\"". The complete set of memorial windows were gifts of the seven Iselin children in honor of their mother. At the time of its construction, St. Gabriel's was one of the most costly houses of worship in the region. The church building, together with the rectory and a home for the Sisters of Charity, it cost $250,000. Another gift was made when the Iselin's transferred its $100,000 gymnasium building and property to the parish for a school for children. Mrs. Iselin would later contribute a $30,000 endowment for the continued maintenance and operation of the church.","St. [[Gabriel'—ï]] is a Roman Catholic [[priesthood]] of the Roman Catholic [[Archdioces–µ]] of New York, located in southern end of the city of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York.

[[In]] [[1827]] he [[relocated]] to [[New]] [[York]] [[City]], where he was a [[commission]] [[agent]] [[engaged]] in the [[sale]] of [[gunpowder]] and other [[products]]. [[In]] [[1837]] he [[bought]] into a gunpowder [[production]] [[company]] that had been [[established]] [[two]] [[years]] [[earlier]] on the [[Scantic]] [[River]] in the [[town]] of [[Enfield]], Connecticut. [[He]] [[assumed]] [[sole]] ownership of the [[company]] in [[1843]]. The [[business]] was [[known]] [[thereafter]] as the [[Hazard]] Powder [[Company]] and the [[village]] that [[supported]] it [[became]] known as [[Hazardville]]. [[During]] the [[early]] years of the [[Civil]] [[War]], Col. [[Hazard]] was under [[suspicion]] by the [[federal]] government as being [[sympathetic]] to the [[Southern]] [[Cause]]. It was [[well]] [[known]] that he was a [[good]] friend of [[Confederate]] [[President]] [[Jefferson]] [[Davis]], and that he [[lived]] in the [[South]] and had [[developed]] [[many]] [[business]] [[relationships]]. [[Shortly]] before [[South]] Carolina [[seceded]] from the Union, it [[bought]] 80,[[000]] lbs. of powder that was used to propel the [[first]] [[shots]] fired on [[Fort]] [[Sumter]]. [[In]] [[fact]], much of the powder in the [[Southern]] Arsenals at the outset of the war was manufactured by the Connecticut [[company]]. The [[rapidly]] [[increasing]] demand for powder [[products]] [[compelled]] Hazard to [[hurriedly]] expand their facilities to [[meet]] [[war]] [[time]] [[production]] [[needs]]. [[Soon]] [[Hazard]] Powder was supplying the [[Union]] Forces with 12,500 lbs of powder a day. The mill at Hazardville was in [[operation]] [[24]] hours a day and [[produced]] 40% of all the [[gunpowder]] used during the [[Civil]] War by the Union. [[Hazard]] lived on Enfield Street in [[Enfield]], several miles from the powder mill, and ran the business until his death on May 7, 1868, at the [[Ascot]] House in [[New]] [[York]] City.","[[Augusto]] [[Georgie]] [[Hazar‘Å]] ([[Apirl]] [[2»¢]], 1802 ‚Äì May 7, [[186»¢]]), [[kno‘ùn]] as [[Colone‚Öº]] [[Augusto]] [[Haz…ërd]], was an [[Ameriœ≤an]] [[manufacture‚≤Ö]] of [[gunpowde‚≤Ö]] and the namesake of Hazardville, [[Connecticuùöù]].

[[Du‚≤Öing]] the [[soon]] years of the [[Civilians]] [[Battle]], Col. [[Hazar‘Å]] was under [[distrust]] by the [[dominion]] government as being [[empathy]] to the [[Southward]] [[Provoke]]. It was [[wel‚Öº]] [[familiar]] that he was a [[buena]] friend of [[Confederaùöùe]] [[Presidenùöù]] [[Montgomery]] [[Davi—ï]], and that he [[inhabited]] in the [[Souùöùh]] and had [[established]] [[numerous]] [[busines—ï]] [[nexus]].

Among many novel ideas and new perspectives introduced by Brock (editorially, visually, and content-wise) was the concept of having each issue follow a topic to unify its thrust, a more graphically compelling look, and a renewed focus on media outside of the small press, namely film, television, and the art world. Brock left the magazine and the website in mid-2012; his last full issue was #19, which focused on extreme horror, though some of his ideas for topics were utilized into 2013, and he was credited as Art Director for issue #20, as the magazine was transitioned to new staff following Brock's departure to become Editor-in-Chief of the biannual horror literary publication Nameless Digest, published by Cycatrix Press.

"L'Abbesse de Jouarre (1886 ‚Äì 6 March 1897) was a [[Thoroughbred]] [[racehorse]] that won the 1889 Epsom Oaks.

Other notable fixtures are played at Ripley in Surrey, vs Goodwood on The Duke of Richmond and Gordon's estate overlooking Goodwood House near Chichester and against Hagley CC at Hagley Hall, the seat of the Lyttelton family and home of current Lord Chris and Lady Tessa Cobham. The club has also played against touring New Zealand cricket team sides and the Marylebone Cricket Club.",0.0015930533409118652,0.7702913284301758,0,2,0,181,"Successful"

Due to its remote [[location]], Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to [[reach]]. [[The]] [[closest]] [[major]] [[highway]], Highway 560, is more than 30 [[km]] north. There are a few logging [[roads]] and trails in the remote area, but they are [[difficult]] to travel in [[poor]] weather. [[The]] most [[popular]] approach [[route]] to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage [[via]] a logging road to the south out of the town of Capreol [[north]] of Sudbury. [[While]] a [[northern]] route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are [[numerous]] portages [[making]] it [[particularly]] onerous. This [[route]] has [[traditionally]] been used for a winter-time [[approach]] by [[ski]]/snowshoe. [[Historically]], a fire tower [[atop]] the [[ridge]] was [[staffed]] by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the [[site]] by [[float]] [[plane]].

The elevation of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level.

In addition, several [[sections]] of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. [[The]] WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight [[traffic]].

The [[story]] [[focuses]] on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The [[supergroup]] [[includes]] well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The [[Battle]] of Ni·∏´riya was the [[culminating]] point of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When ≈†uppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called ·∏™anigalbat. During the [[reign]] of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub), ·∏™anigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when ·∏™attusili III ousted his nephew Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of ·∏™anigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. ·∏™attusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-a≈°ared I and precipitated a crisis with ·∏™atti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tud·∏´alia IV, ·∏™attusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Ni·∏´riya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-a≈°ared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-a≈°ared. The former idea that Ni·∏´riya was to be equated with Na‚Äôiri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong.

To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a [[team]] [[based]] [[outside]] [[England's]] [[borders]].

On [[8]] [[November]] [[1628]] he [[joined]] Lincoln's Inn, where he was [[called]] to the Bar on [[17]] [[May]] 1636.
