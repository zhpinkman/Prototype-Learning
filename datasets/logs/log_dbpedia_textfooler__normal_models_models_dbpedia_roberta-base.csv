"Freeza (Japanese: フリーザ Hepburn: Furīza), spelled Frieza in Funimation's English anime dub, is a fictional [[character]] in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.

Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Freeza is widely considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the series due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, such as Goku's arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek. He is also directly responsible for the murder of Burdock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, and the second death of Kuririn, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy.","Freeza (Japanese: フリーザ Hepburn: Furīza), spelled Frieza in Funimation's English anime dub, is a fictional [[idiosyncrasies]] in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.

The British squadron—under the [[command]] of Rear-Admiral [[Sir]] [[Edward]] Pellew—[[sought]] to [[eliminate]] the [[Dutch]] in an [[effort]] to [[safeguard]] the [[trade]] [[route]] with [[China]], which [[ran]] through the [[Straits]] of Malacca and were in [[range]] of Dutch [[raiders]] [[operating]] from the [[principal]] Javan [[port]] of [[Batavia]]. In the summer of 1806, British [[frigates]] reconnoitred Javan [[waters]] and [[captured]] two Dutch [[frigates]], [[encouraging]] Pellew to [[lead]] a [[major]] [[attack]] on [[Batavia]] that [[destroyed]] the [[last]] [[Dutch]] frigate and [[several]] [[smaller]] [[warships]]. [[Prior]] to the [[Batavia]] [[raid]] however, Dutch Rear-Admiral Hartsinck had [[ordered]] his [[ships]] of the [[line]] to [[sail]] [[eastwards]], where they [[took]] [[shelter]] at Griessie, [[near]] Sourabaya. On the morning of 5 December 1807, a second raiding squadron under Pellew [[appeared]] off Griessie and [[demanded]] that the [[Dutch]] [[squadron]] in the harbour [[surrender]]. The [[Dutch]] [[commander]]—[[Captain]] Cowell—[[refused]], and seized the [[boat]] [[party]] that [[had]] [[carried]] the [[message]]. Pellew [[responded]] by [[advancing]] up the [[river]] and [[exchanging]] [[fire]] with a Dutch [[gun]] [[battery]] on Madura Island, at which [[point]] the [[governor]] in Surabaya [[overruled]] [[Captain]] Cowell, [[released]] the seized [[boat]] [[party]] and agreed to [[surrender]] the [[ships]] at [[anchor]] in Gresik [[harbour]]. By the [[time]] Pellew [[reached]] the [[anchorage]], however, Cowell had [[scuttled]] all of the [[ships]] in shallow [[water]], and Pellew was only [[able]] to [[set]] the wreckage on [[fire]].

"Russells [[Hall]] [[Hospital]] is an NHS [[general]] [[hospital]] [[located]] in Dudley, West Midlands, [[England]], run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The [[hospital]] is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new [[hospital]] included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital.

The [[nurse]] is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the [[nurses]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new [[nurse]] included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital.

"\""Space [[Invaders]]\"" is a [[song]] by Australian songwriters Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown, recording under the band name Player One (commonly stylised as Player [1]) in 1979. The song is based on the hugely successful 1978 video game Space Invaders. It was a novelty hit in Australia, peaking at No. 3 on the Kent Music Report charts, and ending up as the fourth best selling single in Australia for 1980. The song was released internationally but failed to chart outside Australia. It was, however, influential in the history of dance music, being sampled by Jesse Saunders for the bassline of what is commonly held to be the first Chicago house music record, \""On and On\"" (1984).

Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. During the Middle Ages, the town rose to national significance with the establishment of Northampton Castle, which was an occasional royal residence and regularly hosted the Parliament of England. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the University of Northampton, which were all enclosed by the town walls.

The town is also the site of two medieval battles; the Battle of Northampton (1264) and the second in 1460. Northampton's royal connection languished in the modern period; the town supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English Civil War, which culminated in King Charles II ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle.

"The Ten [[Days]] of [[Brescia]] (Italian: Dieci giornate di [[Brescia]]) was a [[revolt]] which [[broke]] out in the northern Italian city of that name, which lasted from March 23 to April 1, 1849.

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow [[rotator]] from the [[inner]] [[regions]] of the asteroid [[belt]], [[approximately]] 4.7 [[kilometers]] in [[diameter]]. [[It]] was [[discovered]] by American [[female]] [[astronomer]] [[Eleanor]] Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.[[S]]. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type [[asteroid]] is a [[member]] of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost [[dense]] [[concentration]] of asteroids in the [[Solar]] System. The asteroid [[orbits]] the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its [[orbit]] has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's [[observation]] arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the [[asteroid]] [[measures]] 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its [[surface]] has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. The minor [[planet]] was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out.

The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971.

The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss.

Because of this the viceroy often had the support of the \""Lima oligarchy,\"" who saw their elite interests threatened by popular rebellion and were opposed to the new commercial class in Buenos Aires. Among the most important events during the war was the proclamation of independence of Peru by José de San Martín on July 28, 1821.",0.0023276209831237793,0.742908239364624,5,0,5,211,"Successful"
