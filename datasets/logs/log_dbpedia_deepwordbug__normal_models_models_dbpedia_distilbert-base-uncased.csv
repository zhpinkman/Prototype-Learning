"[[On]] 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","[[nO]] 20 [[Ocotber]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

"[[Augustus]] [[George]] Hazard ([[April]] [[28]], [[1802]] – [[May]] 7, 1868), known as [[Colonel]] [[Augustus]] Hazard, was an American manufacturer of gunpowder and the namesake of Hazardville, Connecticut. Hazard was [[born]] in [[Kingston]], [[Rhode]] Island on [[April]] [[28]], 1802, a son of Thomas and Silence Knowles Hazard. His family moved to Connecticut when he was six years old. As a young man, he worked as a [[merchant]] in Savannah, Georgia. In 1827 he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission [[agent]] engaged in the sale of [[gunpowder]] and other products. In 1837 he bought into a gunpowder production company that had been established two years earlier on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed sole ownership of the company in 1843. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the village that supported it became known as Hazardville. During the early years of the Civil War, Col. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good [[friend]] of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina seceded from the Union, it bought 80,000 lbs. of [[powder]] that was used to propel the first shots fired on [[Fort]] Sumter. In fact, much of the powder in the Southern Arsenals at the outset of the war was manufactured by the Connecticut company. The rapidly increasing demand for powder products compelled Hazard to hurriedly expand their facilities to meet war [[time]] production needs. Soon Hazard Powder was supplying the Union Forces with 12,500 lbs of powder a [[day]]. The mill at Hazardville was in operation [[24]] hours a day and produced 40% of all the gunpowder used during the Civil War by the Union. Hazard lived on Enfield Street in Enfield, several miles from the [[powder]] mill, and ran the [[business]] until his death on May 7, 1868, at the Ascot House in New York City.","[[Augusuts]] [[Geojrge]] Hazard ([[AprKil]] [[2n]], [[18g02]] – [[Mzay]] 7, 1868), known as [[ColonVel]] [[Augutsus]] Hazard, was an American manufacturer of gunpowder and the namesake of Hazardville, Connecticut.

"[[The]] [[Raid]] on Griessie was a British attack on the Dutch port of [[Griessie]] (later renamed [[Gresik]]) on Java in the [[Dutch]] East Indies in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars.

The British squadron—under the command of [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Sir]] Edward [[Pellew]]—sought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates [[reconnoitred]] Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships.

"[[Russells]] Hall Hospital is an NHS general [[hospital]] [[located]] in Dudley, West Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The [[hospital]] is situated [[south-west]] of the town centre on the [[A4101]] road, which connects to the [[Kingswinford]] area of the borough. [[It]] was first planned in the 1960s as a general [[hospital]] for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new [[hospital]] included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest [[Hospital]] in Dudley and the Corbett [[Hospital]] in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest [[hospitals]], as well as parts of the Corbett [[Hospital]]. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to [[Russells]] Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be [[downsized]] to [[out-patient]] services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's [[in-patient]] services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time [[Russells]] Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had opened the original [[hospital]]. In preparation for the completion of the expanded hospital and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley town centre - Kingswinford Road - was widened into a dual carriageway in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in 1999.

[[The]] Austrian troops under general Nugent, were initially [[surprised]] and retired to the castle, from which they heavily [[cannonaded]] the [[city]], damaging many of Brescia's historical monuments. A total encirclement of Brescia was established by the Austrians beginning on the 8th day of the [[revolt]], when reinforcements arrived. The following day General Haynau, later nicknamed \""The Hyena of Brescia\"", came and demanded the unconditioned [[surrender]] of the Bresciani. As the latter refused, the [[fighting]] continued until late night, when the heads of the revolt decided to [[surrender]]. The following [[day]] ([[April]] 1), however, the Austrian troops sacked the city and massacred numerous inhabitants before the [[surrender]] could be signed.

"Alexander Augustus Norman Dudley \""Jerry\"" [[Pentland]], MC, DFC, AFC (5 [[August]] [[1894]] – 3 November 1983) was an [[Australian]] [[fighter]] [[ace]] in World War I. [[Born]] in Maitland, New [[South]] [[Wales]], he [[commenced]] service as a Lighthorseman with the Australian Imperial [[Force]] in 1915, and saw action at Gallipoli. He [[transferred]] to the [[Royal]] [[Flying]] [[Corps]] the following year, rising to [[captain]]. Credited with twenty-three aerial victories, Pentland became the [[fifth]] [[highest-scoring]] Australian [[ace]] of the [[war]], after Robert Little, [[Stan]] Dallas, [[Harry]] Cobby and Roy King. He was [[awarded]] the Military Cross in January 1918 for \""conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty\"" on a mission attacking an aerodrome behind enemy lines, and the Distinguished Flying Cross that August for engaging four hostile aircraft single-handedly. Pentland served in the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and later the Royal Air Force, before going into business in 1927. His ventures included commercial flying around the goldfields of New Guinea, aircraft design and [[manufacture]], flight instruction, and charter work. In the early 1930s, he was employed as a pilot with Australian National Airways, and also spent time as a dairy farmer. Soon after the outbreak of World War II, he re-enlisted in the RAAF, attaining the rank of squadron leader and commanding rescue and communications units in the South West Pacific.

Vander Starr eventually expanded his [[business]] throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his [[head]] office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a [[subsidiary]] of New York-based American [[International]] Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG [[subsidiary]]), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve [[Bank]] of New York.

However, in March 2010, [[Prudential]] [[PLC]], a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% [[stake]] in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development [[Bank]] (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year [[bancassurance]] agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide [[bank]] branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING [[Group's]] Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was [[informed]] by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea.

Thus the Asian AIA became a [[subsiiary]] of New York-based American [[InternatioZal]] Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG [[sugsidiary]]), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve [[cank]] of New York. AIA was planned to be [[lisated]] in Hong Kong [[Stosk]] Exchange in [[ApSil]] 2010. However, in March 2010, [[Prudental]] [[PL]], a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% [[tsake]] in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development [[Bakn]] (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year [[bancMassurance]] agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide [[banRk]] branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING [[GrSup's]] Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was [[infogrmed]] by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea. In February 2014, the insurer announced that it entered into a five-year major partnership with Tottenham Hotspur. Under the agreement, the AIA brand will feature on the shirts of Spurs players in all competitions until the end of the 2018-2019 season. In June 2014, AIA Singapore was named \""Best Employer to Work For in Asia\"" and received the award from HR Asia.",0.004484117031097412,0.00678938627243042,0,0,0,583,"Failed"

"George Elliott Hagan (May 24, [[1916]] – December 26, 1990) was an American [[politician]], businessman and farmer and a Democrat.

He [[served]] in the Georgia [[House]] of [[Representatives]] from 1939 to 1944, resigned from office to join the United States Army as a member of the [[Signal]] Corps for two years. Following the war, he was returned to the House in 1946 and served until his election to the Georgia [[Senate]] in 1950 where he served for one term, leaving office in 1953. Hagan served in numerous other [[state]] [[government]] positions and also worked in the insurance and financial planning industry and several agricultural pursuits. He [[served]] on the board of trustees for Tift College. In 1960, Hagan challenged incumbent Congressman Prince H.

Preston narrowly prevailed in the [[actual]] [[popular]] [[vote]] (34,318 to 33,629), but under Georgia's [[election]] laws, Hagan defeated Preston on \""county unit\"" votes by a margin of 26 to 18 and went on to win unopposed in the general election (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the time and fielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any congressional race since 1872).

"[[The]] [[Nedbank]] [[Golf]] Challenge, previously [[known]] as the Million Dollar [[Challenge]], is an [[annual]] [[men's]] professional golf [[tournament]] [[played]] at the [[Gary]] Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an official [[money]] [[event]] for any of the major tours, but it became an official tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like [[many]] high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes [[place]] between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas. [[It]] usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players. [[The]] [[tournament]] was a 12-player invitational stroke play [[event]], with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine Tour order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament champion; the top 10 PGA Tour [[FedEx]] Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan [[Golf]] Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%. The standard winner's share on the PGA Tour is 18% and on the European Tour it is 16.67%. In 2006 the winner received $1.2 million out of a total purse of US$4.385 million, so the prize distribution is now not far from the normal pattern for a professional tournament, once allowance is made for the small size of the field. That US$2 million first prize remains the largest in professional [[golf]], but was matched in 2011 by the Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters. [[The]] 2016 [[event]] will be part of the European Tour Final Series, replacing the BMW Masters. Beginning in 2016, the field of 72 will consist mostly of the top (64) available players from the current year Race to Dubai standings. The remainder of the field will consist of the defending champion, prior years winner of the Sunshine Tour order of merit, and tournament invitations.

"[[Oleg]] [[Mikhailovich]] [[Romanishin]] ([[born]] [[10]] [[January]] [[1952]] in Lviv) is a [[Ukrainian]] chess [[grandmaster]] and former European junior champion. Many honours and awards were bestowed on him as a young man. After winning the European Junior Championship in 1973, he [[became]] an International [[Master]] the same year. In 1974 he was a member of the victorious USSR [[team]] at the World Student Team Championship held in [[Teesside]], England, where he scored the best result for board 4 (8/9). The following year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after [[Tigran]] [[Petrosian]]. In 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified. He has an impressive collection of tournament [[victories]] including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, [[Reggio]] Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after [[Hort]]) were also important landmarks in his [[career]], as was his 3rd= finish at [[Sochi]] in 1982. Nowadays less active as a tournament [[player]], he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to win smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as [[Solin-Split]] 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. At the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver. His chess playing style has been described as aggressive and this may be a result of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first coached by Viktor Kart (an instructor of the Lviv [[Sports]] Academy) and then, as an [[improver]], was assigned a senior master as a tutor/mentor. In his case the master was Mikhail Tal, an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","[[tleg]] [[Mijkhailovich]] [[Romanishni]] ([[boyn]] [[1t0]] [[aJnuary]] [[192]] in Lviv) is a [[Ukraniian]] chess [[grandmasker]] and former European junior champion.

"[[Archibald]] (died [[1298]]) was a [[13th-century]] [[Scottish]] [[prelate]] best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope.

"Girl Germs was a [[zine]] created by University of Oregon students Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman, both members of the band Bratmobile. Feminism was influential in the Pacific Northwest in the early nineties: Girl Germs heralded an explosion of zines that accompanied the rebirth of feminism. These zines included Ms America,Satan Wears A Bra, Fantastic Fanzine, I (heart) Amy Carter and others. Girl Germs identified feminist role models in its early issues and was one of the few Riot grrrl zines created by young white women to feature African American rappers. The first issue of Girl Germs was completed by December 1990. While home in Washington, D.C. on winter break, Neuman made several hundred copies of the zine at the Capitol Hill offices of Arizona Representative Mo Udall, who she had worked for during high school. Contributors to Girl Germs included Kathleen Hanna; Jean Smith of Mecca Normal; Sue P. Fox; Kaia Wilson; the editors of Double Bill, G.B. Jones, Jena von Brücker, Caroline Azar, Johnny Noxzema and Rex; Jen Smith; and Erin Smith of Bratmobile. Groups interviewed by Girl Germs editors include Calamity Jane, Unrest, 7 Year Bitch, Jawbox and Fastbacks. Girl Germs also documents the coming together of Bratmobile, during this time. Allison would go on to play with Cold Cold Hearts, Partyline, and Hawnay Troof and Molly played with The Frumpies and The PeeChees.

These zines included Ms America,Satan Wears A Bra, Fantastic Fanzine, I (heart) Amy Carter and others. Girl Germs identified feminist role models in its early issues and was one of the few Riot grrrl zines created by young white women to feature African American rappers. The first issue of Girl Germs was completed by December 1990. While home in Washington, D.C. on winter break, Neuman made several hundred copies of the zine at the Capitol Hill offices of Arizona Representative Mo Udall, who she had worked for during high school. Contributors to Girl Germs included Kathleen Hanna; Jean Smith of Mecca Normal; Sue P. Fox; Kaia Wilson; the editors of Double Bill, G.B. Jones, Jena von Brücker, Caroline Azar, Johnny Noxzema and Rex; Jen Smith; and Erin Smith of Bratmobile. Groups interviewed by Girl Germs editors include Calamity Jane, Unrest, 7 Year Bitch, Jawbox and Fastbacks. Girl Germs also documents the coming together of Bratmobile, during this time. Allison would go on to play with Cold Cold Hearts, Partyline, and Hawnay Troof and Molly played with The Frumpies and The PeeChees.

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] belt, approximately 4.7 [[kilometers]] in [[diameter]]. [[It]] was [[discovered]] by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a [[member]] of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. [[The]] asteroid [[orbits]] the [[Sun]] at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). [[Its]] [[orbit]] has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an [[inclination]] of [[22]]° with respect to the [[ecliptic]]. [[The]] first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation [[arc]] by 8 years prior to its [[discovery]]. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric [[observations]] by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. [[It]] gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=[[3-]]). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.[[02]] hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of [[NASA's]] [[Wide-field]] Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute [[magnitude]] of 13.7. [[The]] minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out.

Born in [[Wickmore]], [[County]] Wexford, Jacob was introduced to hurling in his youth. His granduncle, Jim Mythen, was an [[All-Ireland]] medal winner with Wexford in 1910. Jacob was just sixteen [[years-old]] when he established himself on the [[Oulart-the]] Ballagh junior team. A championship medal winner in the junior and intermediate grades, Jacob lost five senior championship finals. Jacob made his debut on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Wexford minor team. After little success in this grade, he later won an All-Ireland medal with the under-21 team. Jacob joined the senior team during the [[1967-68]] league. He went on to play a key role for Wexford in defence during a successful [[era]], and won one [[All-Ireland]] medal, four Leinster medals and one National Hurling [[League]] medal. Jacob was an [[All-Ireland]] runner-up on [[three]] occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team, Jacob won three Railway Cup medals. Throughout his [[inter-county]] career he made 31 championship appearances. Jacob retired from [[inter-county]] hurling following the conclusion of the 1984 championship. Jacob's siblings- Christy, Robbie and Bridie - also played with distinction at all levels with Wexford. His children - Helena, Ursula, Michael and Rory - have also lined out with Wexford.

"The [[George]] P.

He would follow up immediately, playing on one of the competition's best players, Jonathan Brown of the Brisbane Lions, and Matthew Richardson of Richmond in the next fortnight, holding each to two and one goal(s) respectively.

Tall and mobile, Brown is a former basketballer who converted to football recently, and has been earmarked for centre halfback, following some well acclaimed performances for Vic Country in the 2006 Under 18 National Championships. Brown made his debut for Collingwood in Round One of the 2008 against Fremantle at the Melbourne [[ricket]] Ground in front of 45,000 fans. He immediately made impressions with speed and great defensive attributes against Matthew Pavlich, who is recognised as one of the best forwards in the game, holding him to only one goal. He would follow up immediately, playing on one of the competition's best players, Jonathan Brown of the Brisbane Lions, and Matthew Richardson of Richmond in the next fortnight, holding each to two and one goal(s) respectively. Even though Brown was yet to make his senior debut, he was selected as the Collingwood alternative delegate for the [[AL]] [[PlayerUs]] [[Associtaion]] in 2008, behind [[Tarkny]] Lockyer and [[ick]] Maxwell. Nathan was nominated for the AFL Rising [[tar]] Award for his performance in round 10 2008 against the [[Wes]] Coast Eagles in which Collingwood won by 100 points. Brown won the Harry Collier Trophy (Best first year player) in 2008. Brown celebrated his 50 [[gaem]] in the 2010 [[FL]] Grand Final Replay. He is a former student of [[SIt]] Patrick's [[Clolege]], Ballarat, and was part of their 1st XVIII that won the coveted Herald Shield Cup in 2005. He has a twin brother who plays for the West Coast Eagles, Mitch Brown and an older brother named Cameron. As a child Nathan was a [[barlton]] [[supportFer]], while his twin brother was a [[ColRlingwood]] [[suxpporter]]. At the conclusion of the 2016 season, Brown [[joyned]] the [[t]] [[KiTlda]] [[Footbalcl]] [[Clb]] as a restricted free [[aJent]] after Collingwood elected not to match the contract offer.",0.0010914802551269531,0.0011221766471862793,0,0,0,378,"Failed"

"Willie “The Wisp” [[Galimore]] (March [[30]], [[1935]] – [[July]] [[27]], 1964) was an [[American]] [[football]] running [[back]] for the [[Chicago]] [[Bears]] from 1957–1963. [[He]] attended Florida A&M University, working with the legendary coach Jake Gaither. [[Galimore]] is a member of the College [[Football]] [[Hall]] of [[Fame]]. [[Galimore]] [[possessed]] incredible speed and lateral movement; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed Galimore could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. His running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. [[In]] a documentary short by [[NFL]] Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before NFL scouting became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the 5th round of the 1956 NFL draft. Galimore's peers (including Chuck Bednarik and Doug Atkins) referred to Galimore as one of the best [[runners]] they ever faced. Galimore was killed in an automobile accident on July 27, 1964 in Rensselaer, Indiana at the age of 29 with teammate Bo Farrington. His number 28 has been retired by the Bears.

Willie Galimore's last visit to his hometown of St. Augustine, Florida came just weeks before his death, and he participated in civil rights demonstrations there, becoming the first Black person who was able to register as a guest at the previously all-white Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge (where the arrest of the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts for trying to be served in a racially integrated group had made national headlines a few months before).

[[It]] was only truly recognized as Ontario's highest [[point]] after federal government [[topographical]] [[mapping]] revealed this fact in the 1970s. Before then, the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher. The [[ridge]] [[lies]] in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park. Due to its remote location, Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is a challenge to reach. The closest major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 km north. There are a few logging roads and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach route to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the south out of the town of [[Capreol]] north of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of [[Gowganda]], the nearest community), there are numerous portages making it particularly [[onerous]]. This route has traditionally been used for a winter-time [[approach]] by ski/snowshoe. Historically, a fire tower atop the [[ridge]] was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane. The name \""[[Ishpatina]]\"" comes from an [[Ojibwe]] language word [[ishpadinaa]], meaning \""high place/ridge\"". The city of Ishpeming, Michigan, in Marquette County, and Spadina Avenue in Toronto, Ontario derive their names from the same word. Although the Ishpatina Ridge is the highest [[point]] in Ontario, at least one other geographic feature, Maple Mountain (approximately 25 km to the east) has greater prominence, 37 m (121 ft) higher than Ishpatina Ridge's rise over Scarecrow Lake. An abandoned firetower, often referred to as the Ellis [[Tower]], is still standing on the highest section of the Ridge (left). The original [[tower]] was an 80 ft structure erected in 1930. The successor, currently standing, is 100 ft high and was abandoned in the 1960s. The [[towerman]] would have resided in a cabin on the shore of Scarecrow Lake and would have [[hiked]] a 3.5 km trail daily taking approximately two hours to summit and a little over one hour to descend again. Located between Tower Peak and the North Peak, the Ishpatina Canyon is one of the deepest in Ontario. The elevation of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level. The canyon is nearly twice as deep as Ouimet Canyon, often considered Ontario's deepest. However, the more gradual descent into the canyon hides the fact. The ridge was featured on an interactive web series called The Peakbaggers.","Ishpatina [[Rdge]] is the highest [[poiYnt]] of land in the Canadian province of Ontario, at an estimated [[963]] m (2,274 ft) above sea level.

Although the Ishpatina Ridge is the highest [[poiPnt]] in Ontario, at least one other geographic feature, Maple Mountain (approximately 25 km to the east) has greater prominence, 37 m (121 ft) higher than Ishpatina Ridge's rise over Scarecrow Lake. An abandoned firetower, often referred to as the Ellis [[Lower]], is still standing on the highest section of the Ridge (left). The original [[towe]] was an 80 ft structure erected in 1930. The successor, currently standing, is 100 ft high and was abandoned in the 1960s. The [[toweman]] would have resided in a cabin on the shore of Scarecrow Lake and would have [[hikQed]] a 3.5 km trail daily taking approximately two hours to summit and a little over one hour to descend again. Located between Tower Peak and the North Peak, the Ishpatina Canyon is one of the deepest in Ontario. The elevation of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level. The canyon is nearly twice as deep as Ouimet Canyon, often considered Ontario's deepest. However, the more gradual descent into the canyon hides the fact. The ridge was featured on an interactive web series called The Peakbaggers.",0.003216385841369629,0.0043190717697143555,2,2,2,457,"Failed"

He served in the Kentucky House of [[Representatives]] from 1974 to 1979, was the [[state's]] Attorney General from [[1980]] to 1983, and was the 49th Lieutenant Governor from 1983 to 1987. After graduating from the [[University]] of Kentucky College of [[Law]] in [[1968]], Beshear briefly [[practiced]] [[law]] in New York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a consumer advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as [[attorney]] general, serving under Governor [[John]] Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the [[state's]] classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme [[Court's]] decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis [[George]] Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an [[admission]] fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant [[governor]] in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a [[come-from-behind]] upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington [[law]] firm. His only foray into [[politics]] during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996.

"Geastrum quadrifidum, commonly known as the rayed earthstar or [[four-footed]] earthstar, is an inedible [[species]] of mushroom belonging to the [[genus]] Geastrum, or earthstar fungi. First described scientifically by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794, G. quadrifidum is a [[cosmopolitan]]—but not common—[[species]] of Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, and [[Australasia]]. The fungus is a [[saprobe]], feeding off [[decomposing]] organic matter present in the soil and litter of coniferous forests. The small, tough, fruit bodies are [[grayish-brown]] balls that are initially enclosed by a skin, or peridium, made up of four distinct layers of tissue. The outer tissue layer splits to form [[star-like]] rays and expose a circular spore case. Inside the spore case is the gleba—fertile spore-producing tissue that is white and firm when young, but becomes brown and powdery in age.

Love is a Strange and Different Thing) is a fictional [[manga]] [[written]] and illustrated by Japanese author Taishi Zaō (also known for her shōjo works under the name Mikiyo Tsuda) in 2002. The [[story]] focuses on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi [[Allstars]], both having [[discovered]] the phenomenon through a series of albums published by [[Arhoolie]] Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel [[bands]], with the major difference being a total lack of [[vocals]], both gospel singing and [[sing-song]] preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi [[Allstars]]. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by [[Medeski]] and released on [[Ropeadope]] Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The [[group]] also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

The French expedition started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon perishing in an accidental fire at anchor in the Seine on 6 July 1545.

[[The]] [[line]] was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The [[Cut-Off]] ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The [[Cut-Off]] was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old [[Road]], the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

Almost all Dolomedes [[species]] are semi-aquatic, with the exception of the tree-dwelling D. albineus of the [[southwestern]] United [[States]]. Many [[species]] have a striking pale stripe down each side of the body. They hunt by waiting at the edge of a pool or stream, then when they detect the ripples from prey, they run across the surface to subdue it using their foremost legs, which are tipped with small claws; like other spiders they then inject venom with their hollow jaws to kill and digest the prey. They mainly eat insects, but some [[larger]] [[species]] are able to [[catch]] small fish. They can also [[climb]] beneath the water, when they become encased in a silvery film of air. Six-spotted spiders can also walk on water to get their prey. [[Dolomedes]] is [[derived]] from the Greek [[word]] \""dolomed\"" which means wily, deceitful.

"The Taradale [[Viaduct]] is a [[large]] wrought iron box [[girder]] [[bridge]] over Back Creek at [[Taradale]], Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia.

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 [[July]] [[1894]] – November [[1972]]) was a Welsh [[professional]] [[footballer]] and Wales [[international]]. He began his career at his hometown club [[Cardiff]] City after [[impressing]] in a trial match in [[1912]] that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared [[sporadically]] for the team in the Southern [[Football]] [[League]] before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the [[Football]] Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing [[Jimmy]] Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders. He remained with the [[Bluebirds]] until 1931, when an [[ageing]] squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released. During his time at [[Ninian]] Park, he made over 500 appearances for the club, winning four Welsh Cup titles, the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with the side and is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats. A statue of [[Keenor]], lifting the FA Cup, was erected outside Cardiff's new stadium, the Cardiff City Stadium, in November 2012 following a public fundraising campaign. Keenor finished his [[career]] with spells at [[Crewe]] Alexandra, Oswestry Town and Tunbridge Wells. During his career, he also gained 32 [[caps]] for the Wales national [[football]] team, helping the side win the British Home Championship on three occasions in 1920, 1924 and 1928, and [[captained]] the side on numerous occasions, scoring two goals.

[[In]] 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of [[distractions]] was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's [[Inn]], where he was called to the [[Bar]] on 17 [[May]] 1636. [[As]] a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William [[Laud]]; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, [[Oliver]] Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common [[Pleas]]. [[As]] a judge, [[Hale]] was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the [[law]]. [[He]] [[sat]] in Parliament, either in the [[Commons]] or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of [[Breda]] was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration.

"Herbert Alexander [[Bruce]] FRCS (September [[28]], [[1868]] – June 23, 1963), served as the 15th [[Lieutenant]] [[Governor]] of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937. [[Born]] in [[Blackstock]], Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was [[educated]] as a [[surgeon]] at the [[University]] of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a [[member]] of the Royal College of Surgeons. [[He]] [[owned]] Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he [[founded]] in 1911, and was a [[professor]] of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical [[corps]]. Few of his recommendations for general [[reorganization]] were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his [[appointment]] was protested by Sir William Osler as an [[affront]] to the [[medical]] [[profession]]. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce published [[Politics]] and the Canadian Army Medical [[Corps]], criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on [[nurse-anesthetists]] and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the [[vice-regal]] office in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most [[lieutenant-governors]] are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963. He is buried in section Q-143 in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.","Herbert Alexander [[Bruc]] FRCS (September [[l8]], [[h1868]] – June 23, 1963), served as the 15th [[Lieuteant]] [[GoverFnor]] of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937.

During the event, tours of the artworks and sculptures are undertaken by bicycle along the Upfield bike path, often with an opportunity for the cyclists to meet and engage with the artists. The works are located from Brunswick to Fawkner, and can be accessed by bicycle, train and on foot. The idea for the MoreArt [[event]] was coined by Dan Mitchell, Moreland City Council’s Public Art Officer. The event works \""By encouraging artists to draw inspiration from and utilise disused public space, MoreArt both inserts art into the those places already familiar – if hitherto invisible – to the local community, and invites both Moreland residents and others to subsequently discover – and perhaps better appreciate – the Moreland area while touring the MoreArt “exhibition”. Some artworks are located within the historic station buildings themselves and can include audio and video projections. Other locations include in front of the Brunswick Mechanics Institute and in Victoria Street Mall at Coburg.

The first [[vent]] was held in 2010. During the event, tours of the artworks and sculptures are undertaken by bicycle along the Upfield bike path, often with an opportunity for the cyclists to meet and engage with the artists. The works are located from Brunswick to Fawkner, and can be accessed by bicycle, train and on foot. The idea for the MoreArt [[veent]] was coined by Dan Mitchell, Moreland City Council’s Public Art Officer. The event works \""By encouraging artists to draw inspiration from and utilise disused public space, MoreArt both inserts art into the those places already familiar – if hitherto invisible – to the local community, and invites both Moreland residents and others to subsequently discover – and perhaps better appreciate – the Moreland area while touring the MoreArt “exhibition”. Some artworks are located within the historic station buildings themselves and can include audio and video projections.

"Actinostrobus is a [[genus]] of coniferous trees in the [[Cupressaceae]] (cypress family). [[Common]] [[names]] [[include]] cypress, [[sandplain-cypress]] and cypress-pine, the last of these shared by the closely related genus Callitris. There are [[three]] [[species]] in the genus, all [[endemic]] to southwestern Western Australia: \n* [[Actinostrobus]] [[acuminatus]] - Dwarf cypress, Creeping pine, Moore cypress pine \n* [[Actinostrobus]] arenarius - [[Sandplain-cypress]] \n* [[Actinostrobus]] pyramidalis - Swan river cypress, Swamp cypress, Western Australian swamp cypress, King George's cypress pine A 2010 [[study]] of [[Actinostrobus]] and Callitris has placed all three [[species]] of [[Actinostrobus]] within an expanded Callitris based on [[analysis]] of 42 morphological and anatomical characters. They are [[shrubs]] or small trees, reaching 3–8 m (9.8–26.2 ft) tall. [[The]] leaves are evergreen, of two forms; juvenile needle-like leaves 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long on young seedlings (but occasional into adulthood in A. acuminatus), and scale-like adult leaves, 2–8 mm (0.079–0.315 in) long with only the apex free. The leaves are arranged in six rows along the twigs, in alternating whorls of three. The male cones are small, 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) long, and are located at the tips of the twigs. The female cones start out similarly inconspicuous, maturing in eighteen to twenty months to 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long and wide, globular to acute-ovoid, with six thick, woody scales, arranged in two whorls of three, and a further nine to fifteen thin, sterile basal scales. The cones remain closed on the trees for many years, opening only after being scorched by a bushfire; this then releases the seeds to grow on the newly cleared burnt ground. The closest relative of Actinostrobus is Callitris, which is much more widespread, occurring in most of Australia, and differs in its cones lacking the basal whorls of small sterile scales. [[The]] wood of Actinostrobus is light, soft and aromatic, but the plants are too small for any significant use.

"Col [[de]] Pierre [[Pertuis]] (el. 827 m.) is a [[mountain]] pass in the Jura Mountains in the [[canton]] of Bern in Switzerland. It connects Sonceboz and [[Tavannes]]. The name of the [[pass]] comes from the Latin: Petra pertusa, meaning [[broken]] rock. The pass road has been dated to the second half of the 1st century AD.

"[[Ellis]] [[Edgar]] \""[[Puss]]\"" [[Achong]] ([[16]] [[February]] [[1904]] – [[29]] [[August]] [[1986]]) was a [[sportsman]] from [[Trinidad]] and [[Tobago]] in the [[West]] [[Indies]]. He [[played]] cricket for the West [[Indies]] and was the [[first]] [[person]] of known Chinese descent to [[play]] in a [[Test]] match. Left-arm unorthodox spin ([[left-arm]] wrist spin) is sometimes known as \""slow left-arm chinaman\"" (SLC) which is thought to be in his honour. Achong was [[born]] in Belmont, Port of Spain. He [[played]] football as a left-winger for a local team, Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and represented Trinidad and Tobago from 1919 to 1932. Achong is better known for playing cricket. He was mainly a bowler. His stock ball was left-arm orthodox spin (left-arm finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire Joe Hardstaff Sr., \""fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\"". Learie Constantine is said to have replied: \""Do you mean the bowler or the ball?\"" An unorthodox left-arm spin delivery (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a right-handed [[batsman]]) is known as a \""[[chinaman]]\"" as a result. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded Test match player to bowl unorthodox left-arm spin – that is believed to be Charles Llewellyn of South Africa. Achong played in six Test matches for the West Indies against the English cricket team from 1930 to 1935, three in the West Indies and three in the 1933 tour of England. In all, Achong took eight Test wickets at a bowling average of 47.25, but his Test figures [[belie]] his much greater success at regional level in the West Indies between 1929–30 and 1934–35. In the final of the Inter-Colonial Tournament of 1931–32, he took 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to bowl Trinidad to victory over British Guiana. He married during the 1933 tour of England and settled in Manchester. After his last Test match, he continued to play cricket for several clubs in the Lancashire Leagues until 1951, taking over 1,000 wickets, including 10 in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in 1945. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.

"Carmarthen [[Cemetery]] Chapel is a [[cemetery]] chapel in the town of Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire, Wales. The building dates from 1855 and is [[located]] at 6, Russell Terrace, Carmarthen.

Asiatic toads are also found on the [[iyako]] Islands of southern Japan, although they have been extirpated from some islands in recent years, possibly including Okinawa. The Miyako subspecies, Bufo gargarizans miyakonis, is also known as the Miyako toad. The Asiatic toad avoids dense forests, but is found in most other habitats, including grasslands, open forests, and cultivated areas. [[tI]] prefers humid areas, and is seldom [[foun]] at altitudes of more than 800 meters. [[Te]] Asiatic toad plays an important role in traditional Oriental medicine. An extract of the [[oxins]] [[secreetd]] by the toad, known as toad venom or [[chanCsu]], has long been [[touteX]] for its medicinal properties. In addition, dried toad skins have been prescribed as remedies for dropsy and other ailments. More recently, Western medical science has also taken an interest in the toad. In 1998, an antimicrobial peptide was extracted from the toad, and patented.

He left [[perlings]] at this time and organised his own [[compzany]], E. Mackay Edgar Ltd, with offices in [[JLondon]], Montreal and New [[YoUrk]] City. This ended when he retired due to ill-health, but in 1928 he returned with a new [[coampany]], Beeston's Trust Ltd, which folded during the Depression and in 1931 he again [[wnet]] into receivership. Mackay Edgar was also a notable figure in powerboat racing, owning a [[numfber]] of winning boats. He won the Harmsworth [[TJophy]] for two consecutive [[yaers]] (1912 and 1913) with his [[boaO]] Maple Leaf IV. Mackay Edgar's only son, John, was killed in a car accident in July 1925 and the baronetcy therefore became extinct upon his death. Mackay Edgar and his wife, Ethel Beatrice (née Pinder), a fellow native of Montreal whom he married in 1902, are buried in the cemetery in [[Chalont]] St [[PeteOr]], [[Buckighamshire]].",0.0010985136032104492,0.001204371452331543,0,0,0,288,"Failed"

"[[Athanasios]] John Traicos ([[born]] 17 [[May]] [[1947]]) is a [[former]] [[cricketer]] who represented [[South]] [[Africa]] and Zimbabwe at [[international]] [[level]]. He was primarily an off [[spin]] [[bowler]], and is one of a small [[number]] of cricketers to have played at the highest level for more than one country. Traicos was [[born]] in Zagazig, Egypt in [[1947]] where his father Tryphon worked in the [[family]] [[business]]. He is of Greek descent, his father having been born in Lemnos, Greece and his maternal grandmother in Kalymnos, also in Greece. In [[September]] [[1948]] the family moved to what was then Fort Victoria in Southern Rhodesia. As a child he was known as \""[[Naso]]\"", a contraction of his [[name]] \""Athanasios\"", but when he started university he adopted the name \""John\"". Traicos grew up in Rhodesia and played for that country, which at the time was regarded as a \""province\"" within the [[South]] African domestic cricket setup. While a student at the [[University]] of Natal he benefited from being coached by Trevor Goddard making his first-class debut on 24 June 1967 when he represented South African Universities against Cambridge University, taking 5–54 in the first innings. He represented the South African Universities team on two more occasions before making his Rhodesia debut on 27 January 1968. He made his Test match debut for South Africa against Australia at Durban in February 1970 while still a student, having been selected at the request of the South African captain Ali Bacher. He took four catches and three [[wickets]] in his debut Test. However, after his three appearances in this series, South Africa were banned from international cricket because of apartheid. Traicos continued to play for Rhodesia, and after the country was renamed in 1980 represented Zimbabwe in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 ICC Trophy tournaments. He also played for Zimbabwe in the 1983 Cricket World Cup, and was an important part of the side which inflicted a shock defeat on Australia. Zimbabwe were raised to Test status in 1992, and Traicos was selected for the country's inaugural Test match, at [[Harare]] Sports Club against India. This appearance came a record 22 years and 222 days after his previous Test appearance, and he repaid the selectors' decision with his best Test bowling figures of 5/86. He played three more Tests for Zimbabwe, and his final appearance came at the age of 45 years and 304 days, making him the oldest Test player since Miran Bux 38 years earlier, and the twelfth oldest of all time. He would have been even further up the list had he been available for selection for the following year's tour of Pakistan, but Traicos' business commitments prevented this. In 1997, Traicos and his family moved to Australia as a result of political instability in Zimbabwe and settled in Perth.

"The [[Usoi]] Dam is a natural landslide dam along the [[Murghab]] River in Tajikistan. At [[567]] metres (1,[[860]] ft) high, it is the tallest dam in the world, either natural or man-made. The dam was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4-Ms [[Sarez]] earthquake caused a massive landslide that blocked the [[flow]] of the river. The [[dam]] is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of rock dislodged from the [[steeply]] sloped river valley of the Murghab, which cuts from east to west through the high and rough [[Pamir]] Mountains. It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the [[1911]] [[landslide]]. The [[dam]] rises to a height of 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the original valley floor. The basin formed by [[Usoi]] [[Dam]] now holds [[Sarez]] Lake, a 55.8-kilometre (34.7 mi)-long lake holding 16.[[074]] cubic kilometres (13,031,000 acre·ft) of water. Water does not [[flow]] over the top of the [[dam]], which would quickly cause it to [[erode]] away; instead, water [[seeps]] out of the base of the [[dam]] at a rate which approximately matches the [[rate]] of inflow, maintaining the lake at a relatively constant level. The flow averages about 45 cubic meters per second, and dissipates about 250 megawatts. Geologists are [[concerned]] that the [[Usoi]] [[Dam]] may become unstable during future large-magnitude earthquakes, which are relatively common in the seismically active Pamirs, and might collapse due to liquefaction or subsequent landslides during such an event. Collapse of the dam would unleash a locally catastrophic flood. The [[Murghab's]] river valley tends to be relatively narrow and steep. This would focus and maintain any flood's destructive power as it swept through the valley of the Murghab District.","The [[UVsoi]] Dam is a natural landslide dam along the [[MurghGb]] River in Tajikistan.

Kelly first stood for parliament at the 1939 state election, as an \""independent Labor\"" candidate, but was defeated in the seat of [[Yilgarn-Coolgardie]] by the endorsed Labor candidate, George Lambert. Lambert died in office in June 1941, and Kelly won the resulting [[by-election]] as an \""independent Country\"" candidate.

Lambert died in office in June 1941, and Kelly won the resulting [[by-electHon]] as an \""independent Country\"" candidate. At the 1943 [[tate]] election, Kelly was re-elected to Yilgarn-Coolgardie as a plain independent. However, he joined the Labor Party in July 1946, and was re-elected unopposed as a Labor candidate at the 1947 [[tate]] election. At the 1950 election, Kelly's seat was abolished, and he transferred to the new [[sat]] of [[Merredin-YilgQarn]]. After Labor's victory at the 1953 election, he was [[mae]] Minister for [[Mine]] and Minister for Fisheries in the new ministry formed by Albert Hawke. He was also [[mare]] Minister for Industrial Development in 1954. In a reshuffle in December 1957, he lost the [[minfes]] and industrial development [[portflios]], but was [[maGe]] Minister for Lands and Minister for Agriculture. The Labor government was defeated at the 1959 state election. Kelly remained in [[paliament]] until his retirement at the 1968 [[eVlection]]. [[Merredim-Yilgarn]] had become increasingly marginal, and the replacement Labor candidate, James Brown, was defeated by the Liberal Party's [[tack]] Stewart (although Labor reclaimed the seat three years later). After leaving parliament, Kelly served on the [[bEard]] of various [[mmning]] firms. He died in Perth in April 1977, aged 80. Kelly was married twice, firstly in 1924 to Inez Marie Jackson, with whom he had three children. He was widowed in 1931, and remarried in 1934 to Eva Florence Roberts, with whom he had another four children.",0.0010783672332763672,0.0011472702026367188,0,0,0,448,"Failed"

"1863 [[Antinous]], provisional designation 1948 EA, is a [[stony]] [[asteroid]] classified as near-Earth object, that measures about 2 [[kilometers]] in diameter. It was [[discovered]] on March 7, 1948 by American astronomer Carl [[Wirtanen]] at Lick [[Observatory]] on the summit of Mount Hamilton, California. Antinous is also classified as a [[Mars-crosser]] and [[Apollo]] [[asteroid]]. The SU/Sq-type [[asteroid]] [[orbits]] the [[Sun]] at a distance of 0.9–3.6 AU once every 3 years and 5 months (1,240 days). Its [[orbit]] has a high eccentricity of 0.61 and is tilted by 18 degrees to the [[ecliptic]] plane. [[It]] takes 7.46 hours to rotate around its axis. Its albedo is 0.240, while other observations find a much lower value of 0.10–0.11. [[It]] has an Earth Minimum [[orbit]] intersection distance (MOID) of 0.1829 AU. In the 20th century Antinous passed within 30 Gm of the Earth five times; it will do so only once in the 21st. The nearest distance increases each time, from 26 to 29 Gm.

Attorneys General from several other states [[joinmed]] the suit, with Moore as the lead [[negotiatoI]]. The settlement was worth $246 billion to the states, including $4.1 billion for Mississippi.

In 1989, during his first term as Attorney General, Moore ran in a special election for the U.S. House of Representatives in the fifth congressional district (today the fourth) following the death of Representative Larkin I. Smith. Despite being the favorite among Democrats, Moore came in third in the initial round of [[blloting]], behind Democratic state [[eSnator]] Gene Taylor and Republican Tom Anderson.

"Faxinalipterus is a genus of vertebrate, possibly a pterosaur, from the Late Triassic [[Caturrita]] Formation of southern Brazil. The type [[species]], [[Faxinalipterus]] minima was named and [[described]] in 2010 by José Fernando [[Bonaparte]], Marina [[Bento]] Soares and César Leandro Schultz. The [[generic]] name is derived from [[Faxinal]] do Soturno and a Latinised Greek pteron, \""wing\"". The specific name, from Latin minimus, means \""smallest\"". Fossils of the [[species]] were found in 2002 and 2005 at a site 1.5 kilometres northeast of [[Faxinal]] do Soturno, Rio Grande do Sul, from the [[Caturrita]] Formation dating from the [[Carnian-Norian]], 220–215 million years old. The holotype, [[UFRGS]] [[PV0927T]], is part of the collection of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and consists of several, partially fragmentary, limb elements, perhaps of a single individual. These do not include bones from the hand. An upper jaw fragment, a left maxilla with three teeth, has been referred to the [[species]]. [[Faxinalipterus]] is a rather [[small]] animal, with an estimated total humerus length of eighteen millimetres. The size has been compared to that of a sparrow. The hind limbs, much better conserved than the front limbs, are relatively long. From the maxilla it can be inferred that the skull is deep and lightly built with large openings. The maxillary teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are elongated and recurved. The describers have assigned Faxinalipterus to the Pterosauria, based on its long hollow limbs and saddle-shaped upper joint of the relatively short and robust humerus, suitable to perform a wing stroke. They see it as perhaps the oldest pterosaur known, as it possibly predates European finds from the Norian. That the possible age difference cannot be large, they see as an indication of rapid evolution in early [[pterosaurs]]. Because the Caturrita Formation consists of terrestrial sandstones, that evolution would have had its origins in a terrestrial, not coastal, habitat. They also concluded [[Faxinalipterus]] is the most basal known [[pterosaur]], basal features including a lack of fusion between tibia and fibula, a thin radius and a coracoid that has not fused to the [[scapula]]. However, Alexander [[Kellner]] has suggested Faxinalipterus might be not be a pterosaur but a basal member of the Pterosauromorpha instead or, if the lack of fusion between tibia and fibula is plesiomorphic, even a sister taxon of the Ornithodira. Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia (2013) stated that he was \""unable to find any unequivocal pterosaur features\"" in the known fossils of F. minima; in fact, according to the author, \""the purported humerus is quite unlike the humeri of the Triassic pterosaurs\"".

"Cova da Iria (\""Irene's Cove\"") was a field belonging to the [[family]] of Lúcia Santos in Fatima, Portugal. Lucia was one of the three visionary [[children]] who, according to Roman Catholic Church, received several visitations and messages by the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God. The Children used to frequently pasture their sheep on this land, and it was on May 13, 1917, around noon, that Our Lady of Fatima appeared to the three of them. The story goes that suddenly there was lightning, and the children, Lúcia Santos and Jacinta and Francisco Marto, thinking that it was going to rain, began to run. Then, just above an oak tree, they saw a beautiful lady made of light, holding a rosary in her hand.

İhsanoğlu's [[academic]] work has focused on the history of scientific activity and institutions of [[learning]] within Islam, cultural exchanges between Islam and the West, the relationship between science and religion, and the development of science in its socio-cultural environment. İhsanoğlu was the founder of the Department of History of Science at the [[Faculty]] of Letters of Istanbul University, and he [[remained]] the chairman of that [[department]] between 1984 and 2003.

"[[Wilfred]] Talbot Smith ([[born]] [[Frank]] [[Wenham]]; 8 [[June]] [[1885]] – [[27]] [[April]] [[1957]]) was an [[English]] occultist and ceremonial magician known as a prominent [[advocate]] of the religion of Thelema.

Born the illegitimate [[son]] of a [[domestic]] servant and her employer in [[Tonbridge]], Kent, Smith migrated to [[Canada]] in 1907, where he went through a variety of [[jobs]] and began [[reading]] about Western esotericism. Through [[Charles]] [[Stansfeld]] Jones he was introduced to the writings of Thelema's founder, [[Aleister]] [[Crowley]]. He subsequently [[joined]] Crowley's [[Thelemite]] order, the A∴A∴, and the Thelemite wing of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). In 1915, he joined the O.T.O.'s [[British]] Columbia Lodge No. 1, based in Vancouver, and rose to become one of its senior members. In 1922 Smith moved to Los Angeles in the United States, where he, Jane Wolfe, and Regina Kahl tried to establish a new Thelemite community. They founded an incorporated Church of Thelema which gave weekly public performances of the Gnostic Mass from their home in Hollywood. Seeking to revive the inactive North American O.T.O., in [[1935]] Smith then founded the O.T.O. Agape Lodge, which subsequently relocated to Pasadena. He brought a number of prominent Thelemites into the O.T.O., including Jack Parsons and Grady Louis McMurtry, but he had a strained relationship with both Crowley and Crowley's North American deputy, Karl Germer, who eventually ousted him from his position as Agape Lodge leader, replacing him with Parsons.
