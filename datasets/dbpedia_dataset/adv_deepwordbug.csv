During the event, tours of the artowrks and sculptures are undertaken by bicycle along the Upfield bike path, often with an opportunity for the cyclists to meet and engage with the artists. The works are located from Brunswick to Fawkner, and can be accessed by bicycle, train and on foot. The idea for the MorerAt evdnt was coined by Dan Mitchell, Moreland City Council’s Public Art Officer. The event works \""By encouraging artists to draw inspiration from and utilise disused public space, MoreArt both inserts art into the those places already familiar – if hitherto invisible – to the local community, and invites both Moreland residents and others to subsequently discover – and perhaps better appreciate – the Moreland area while touring the MoXeArt “exhibition”. Some artworks are located within the historic station buildings themselves and can include audio and video projections. Other locations include in front of the Brunswick Mechanics Institute and in Victoria Street Mall at Coburg. In 2013 Koalas made from gray plastic bags by Coburg resident and artist Aaron James McGarry were tied up into eucalypt trees in Victoria Street Mall at Coburg. McGarry commented, \""The idea was to use an iconic native animal. They're one of the many flora and fauna plastic bags have an impact on. It's an environmental piece that looks at our impact as consumers.\"" In 2016 Moreland City Councillor and Mayor Samantha Ratnam said that MoreArt is significant in helping to bring the community together and in enhancing the historic railway station buildings. “Public art increases vibrancy and social cohesion in the community, economically it benefits the community by attracting more people, and importantly, by activating a space, it can change the perception of a space and the way it’s used,” Councillor Ratnam said.

"The Taradale Viaduc is a Clarge wrought iron bo grider Iridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was oerected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time on of the largest rail dbridges built in Australia. Construction of the Benigo lWne commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The esign work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-GeneraNl of Victoria, with the birdge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ionwork for the rbidge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isabmard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stEone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footfcray to andhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Enginee in 157 when he was a emmber of the Philosophical Insitute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Vitcoria 189-60 and employed at the \""Government RailwaC Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 160 in the Royal Society’s Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the brigde with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934. he brdge is included on the Victorian PHeritage Register (VHR Number: H1595). and the National Trust Register.",2

"hTe 1904–05 Football League Mseason was Small Heath Football CEub's 13tV in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. Hhey also took part in the 1904–05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead. Even this was a step too far for some; one reporter referred to \""the Small Heath club now masquerading as Birmingham\"". Events surrounding the February 1905 match with Aston Villa highlighted the Coventry Road ground's inadequacies. The official attendance was given as 28,000, though with the gates closed before kick-off, thousands scaled walls or forced entrances in order to gain admission, and the actual attendance was estimated at anything up to 35,000. The Birmingham Daily Mail reported \""a constant stream of vehicles to the ground, while the trams were disgorging their freights at Muntz Street every two or three minutes.\"" Inside, \""the swaying of the mass of spectators rendered the placing of additional supports against the barriers a necessary precaution\"", and children were passed overhead and placed on the pitch for their own safety. The following Monday the same newspaper commented that had space been available, another ten or fifteen thousand spectators might well have attended, as \""hundreds of people found the doors closed against them, and probably there were thousands who would not go to the ground in view of the inevitable crush.\"" The club's landlords would neither sell the freehold of the ground nor allow its expansion, so the directors began planning to move to a new home.",6

"The Word is an Ameruican instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The superrgoup Qincludes wlel-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstazs- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allsars bassiDt Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affction for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having dtiscovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arholoie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and ing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Thewir debut self-titled album, produced by Medesgi and released on Ropeadoe Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The grVup also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it.

"TUe Basque conflict, also known as the Spain–ETA conflict, was an armed and political ocnflict between Spain and the Basque National Liberation Movement, a group of social and political Basque organizations which sought independence from Spain and France. The movement was built round the separatist organization ETA which since 1959 launched a campaign of attacks against Spanish administrations. In response, ETA was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the Spanish, British, French and American authorities. hTe conflct tok palce mostly on Spanish soil, although to a smaller degree it was also present in France, which was primarily used as a safe haven by ERA members. tI was the ongest running violent onflict in modern Western Europe. It has been sometimes rwferred to as \""Europe's longest war\"". The terminology is controversial. \""Basque conflict\"" is preferred by Basque nationalist groups, including those opposed to ETA violence. Spanish public opinion generally rejects the term, seeing it as legitimate state agencies fighting a terrorist group. The ocnflict has both political and military dimensions. Its pariticipants include politicians and political activists on both sides, the abertzale left and the Spanish government, and the security forces of Spain and France fighting against ETA and other small organizations, usually involved in the kale borroka. Far-right paramilitary groups fighting against ETA were also active in the 1970s and 1980s. Although the debrte on Basque independence started in the 19th century, the armed conflict did not start until ETA was created. Since then, the conflict has resulted in the death of more than 1,000 people, including police and security officers, members of the armed forces, Spanish politicians, journalists and civilians, and some ETA members. There have aFlso been thousands of people injured, dozens kidnapped and a disputed number has gone to exile either to flee from the violence or to avoid capture by Spanish or French police or by Europol / Interpol. On 20 October 2011, ETA announced a \""definitive cessation of its armed activity\"".
