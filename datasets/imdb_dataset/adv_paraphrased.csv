"I rented a movie because the box looked cool with a guy's face axed in half. It turned out to be a masterpiece with many references to ""Evil Dead"" and other movies. The plot, characters, effects, and humor were all good, but it was slow before the main character went insane. I gave it a 9 and recommend it to fans of ""Evil Dead 2"" and similar movies.",1
"The film was inspired by the fact that American gangsters dress well, while Australian ones can dress poorly without criticism due to their violent tendencies. The story follows Jimmy, an illegal boxer and bouncer who works for local gangster boss Pando in Australia's Kings Cross District. After messing up a job due to love, Jimmy must repay Pando before he is killed. The film explores the nature of Australian criminals and has dark humor and interesting action, but lacks depth in some areas. It is recommended to watch with ""Chopper"" and ""Dirty Deeds"" for an Aussie crime fest or ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Miller's Crossing"" for an international criminal gang theme. Bryan Brown is a great actor who has done many bad movies, but this is one of his great ones.",1
"The movie is not impressive, with a cast resembling a Saved by the Bell reunion and a poorly designed monster. The military is portrayed as useless, with even highly trained individuals like navy seals and marines dying easily. The plot involves a crazy cryptozoologist trapping a Chupacabra and smuggling it onto a cruise ship, where it is released by two crew members. The only noteworthy part is when the captain's daughter defeats the monster with martial arts, despite the fact that it had previously wiped out an entire navy seals unit.",0
"This movie is a typical New York comedy that relies on the city's craziness to make up for a lack of talent. The characters have no clear motives and the plot is just a series of poorly written scenes. While there are some amusing moments, overall the movie is a disappointment. If you want to watch a good light-hearted crime movie, try ""Brother"" instead. The director should focus on exciting, amusing, enlightening, or entertaining the audience instead of being boring.",0
"Steve Railsback's lead roles are typically good, but Lifeforce is an exception. The confusing horror/sci-fi film improves towards the end when London becomes Zombie City, but overall it is difficult to watch. The naked spacegirl/vampire is the only redeeming quality. It deserves a 4 out of 10 rating.",0
"Red Sonja, played by Brigitte Nielsen, is a female version of Conan and the film feels cheap. Arnold Schwarzenegger appears in the film but not as Conan and only appears every twenty minutes. The film is slow and boring, so watch Conan the Barbarian instead.",0
"Gregory Peck and Gig Young compete for the same woman. Peck sends Young on a dangerous mission and is blamed. Feeling guilty, Peck defends a fort with a group of soldiers he considers to be the worst. The script is based on a novel by Charles Marquis Warren, a western specialist. The film inspired later movies, including ""The Dirty Dozen.""",1
"Visitors is a slow and unenjoyable movie, despite its short length. The action scenes are good, but the slow pacing and lack of clear explanation for the hauntings make it hard to recommend. The creepy setting and effective use of atmosphere are not enough to make up for the overall boredom and derivative nature of the film.",0
"Ramón brings his college friends to an abandoned school building to investigate a diary from his dying father. They relive a horrifying episode from 20 years ago where a sadistic security guard kills five of six people. As they try to escape, the killer hunts and destroys them in various bloody ways. The film has professional gloss, shocking violence, and witty dialogue with pop-culture references. The use of cues and flashbacks may annoy some viewers, but the plot moves quickly, and the camera follows the characters' reactions to the chaotic situation. The paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot may affect your enjoyment of the film. The twist is abrupt, but it works with the story. As a slasher flick, it's a breath of fresh air.",1
"Six of a Kind features W.C. Fields in a memorable 10-minute scene, including his famous pool sequence from vaudeville. The remaining 55 minutes are enjoyable, largely due to Charlie Ruggles' hilarious performance as the bumbling banker J. Pinkham Whinney, with Mary Boland and George Burns and Gracie Allen also providing comedic moments. While Gracie can become tiresome, the overall situation is consistently funny as the Whinneys and their companions embark on a road trip to California. The film receives an 8/10 rating.",1
"A documentary explores the 1993 siege of a religious compound in Waco, Texas, where 76 people, including the sect leader, died in a fire. The cause of the fire is still disputed, raising questions about government ethics.",1
"In 2055, the wealthy can travel back in time to hunt live dinosaurs for a high price through Time Safari, a business that uses Sonia Rand's time machine. Dr. Travis Ryer leads a team to kill a dinosaur, but a hunter accidentally steps on and kills a butterfly, causing major changes to the earth's climate and evolution. Travis and Sonia attempt to stop the changes before they become permanent and lead to human extinction. The movie received a 4/10 rating and was criticized for its slow pace and unrealistic concept of a single butterfly causing significant changes.",0
Michael Jackson's music video featuring Vincent Price's rap and zombies dancing with him is one of his best. He is a favorite singer and one of the best in the world.,1
"Since 1996, I have been continuously satisfied by this movie and novel. Even after ten years, I still remember every dialogue. It is perfect, and I particularly love Willem Defoe's unique voice and the spiritual music by Szararem. No one can replicate this masterpiece. Thank you to Ondaatje and Mingela.",1
"The marketing for 'The New Twenty' features a half-naked male on the poster/home video cover, making it a must-see for fans of gay-themed movies. Despite the stereotyped gay characters, the film focuses on long-term friendship and characters growing apart, with more heterosexual couples having sex outside of marriage. The film feels more suited for TV than the big screen, lacking originality and dealing with familiar themes such as AIDS and drug addiction. The most interesting character is the heavier-set one, Ben.",0
"A 6-part miniseries intertwines four stories about the drug trade in Europe. A German businessman's wife continues his illegal trade after he is arrested, while the British Home Secretary's daughter becomes addicted to heroin during his trip to Pakistan to negotiate an aid package. The original miniseries is superior to its American adaptations, portraying the poverty and desperation of the third world in a stark, uncompromising, and brutal manner.",1
"By mistake, I watched a serious movie on Lifetime about a young woman being attacked by a fellow student who thinks he's above the system. The cast was believable and the performances credible, making it better than the average film of this type. However, the movie seemed slow and repetitive, and the climax could have been given more detail and length.",1
"I watched a bad movie that used the tired trope of a martial arts teacher turned actor fighting his way through a boring plot. The only reason I watched it was because the lead actress was pretty. The movie has many mistakes, which can be fun to find or bothersome for perfectionists. Hopefully, these types of movies will stop being made, but then where will low budget actors go?",0
"Advent Children may please fans of the original game with its familiar settings, characters, music, and action scenes, but it falls short as a standalone movie due to sloppy direction during fight scenes, lack of character development, and a weak plot. The CG is impressive, but not as detailed as in Spirits Within. The film serves more as a side story than a true sequel and is a brainless action flick. The author is not bothered by negative feedback from fans.",0
"The show should have continued with new storylines after season 2. It presents both normal and extremist views of Islam and tackles controversial topics in a meaningful way. The show is well-cast and believable, and it is unfortunate that the writer did not discover it until 2007.",1
"Eisenstein's 1938 film ""Nevsky"" retells the battle of the ice of 1242, with the Germanic knights representing the Nazis. The film is a piece of propaganda and marks Eisenstein's return to official favor after a decade of being out of favor with Stalin. The film's strong points are the battle scenes and Prokofiev's soundtrack, but the comic relief is jarring.",1
"Lestat wakes up after a 100-year sleep to new music and forms a band, angering other vampires and awakening an ancient evil. The film is not a faithful adaptation of the book, but is satisfying overall with good casting and sexy relationships. The story is compelling and draws the viewer in, with simmering sensuality and sexual tension.",1
"'Beep Beep' is the second popular Road Runner cartoon by Chuck Jones, which improves on its predecessor with longer and more ambitious sequences, including a chase through an old mine and a funny gag with rocket-powered roller-skates. The representation of Wile E. Coyote is also improved, with better looks to the camera. Although slow to start, 'Beep Beep' confirms the potential for a series to be made from these characters.",1
"Despite some predictability, House of Wax is one of the best horror/suspense films from Hollywood in years, delivering chills, thrills, and gore. While some parts are far-fetched and the acting is not great, the movie is still rated an eight out of ten. It's perfect for those who enjoy being on the edge of their seats and offers a unique perspective on wax museums.",1
"Despite the implausible plot, the film is worth watching for the outstanding performances of Caine and Gambon, with the latter delivering an impressive Dublin accent. Caine's exaggerated acting suits his character well, making the film enjoyable and easy to watch for an hour and a half.",1
"The commenter agrees with some points but disagrees on others. They do not believe the film is similar to ""THE CARS THAT ATE Paris"" and instead see it as a weird Euro work with some surreal elements. They praise the music by Heuzenroeder for its use of whistling and consider it better than most Australian films. They express confusion over the film's title and make a reference to David Bowie.",1
"The movie ""Secretos"" has a predictable plot based on a novel, but is carried by strong dramatic performances from Jordana Brewster, Christopher Eccleston, and Blythe Danner. The story follows Jordana's character and her sister's ex-boyfriend as they travel to Europe to uncover the truth behind her sister's death. The film includes minimal nudity and the sex scenes are not intended to be steamy. Overall, it is a great choice for those who enjoy solid dramatic features. The ending is particularly moving, with flashbacks of the two little sisters.",1
"I enjoyed this movie, which has a straightforward plot and is reportedly based on a true story. Despite my affinity for 80's hard rock/hair metal, the film is enjoyable even without the music. It's worth watching unless you're an extremely critical viewer who only appreciates movies of ""Citizen Kane"" quality.",1
"The sequel to the original Robocop film is set in Old Detroit, where the Omni Consumer Corporation is constructing a new city and a drug lord named Cain is causing trouble. Robocop tries to stop him but gets destroyed, leading to the creation of a new android. The film tries to capture the magic of the first one but falls short, with excessive violence and a mean-spirited tone. Overall, it leaves the viewer feeling apathetic and wondering why they aren't watching the original instead.",0
"I expected a low-budget American movie with bad actors, but was pleasantly surprised by the natural performance of the lead actor in the film about a student who creates a fake school. Despite opposition, the school becomes popular and offers a unique learning experience. The film has flaws but is a cheerful, feel-good movie with unexpected plot twists.",1
"Death Wish 3 is the second best movie in the series, with Death Wish 5 being the best. The movie features a New York neighborhood plagued by a single, violent gang. Deborah Raffin plays a public defender and adds a gentle touch to the action-packed film. The protagonist, Kersee, uses a new gun called the Wildey .475 Magnum, which packs a big punch. Kersee also uses an antitank missile to kill the main gang leader, which is an unusual weapon for a vigilante.",1
"The writer strongly disagrees with the previous comments and believes the film is worse than ""Carry on Columbus."" They feel that the humor has not progressed and that actors like Charles Hartrey and Barbara Windsor were out of place. The writer believes that the series continued with subpar films like ""Carry on Behind"" and ""Carry on England,"" but ""Carry on Dick"" was not bad. However, the writer believes that this film signaled the end of the series, which is a shame because there were no bad films before this one.",0
"The movie about making a movie is pointless and lacks the enjoyable elements of the original, including the fun music. However, the appearance of the Pathmark guy is entertaining.",0
"The movie about the first attack on the World Trade Center is unlikely to be shown on HBO or re-released, but can be found in video stores. It highlights the failure of government agencies to prevent the attack and is chilling because we now know it was not the end of the terrorist threat. The film is difficult to watch after the events of 9/11 and the ending is powerful and prophetic. It is recommended to not watch the movie alone.",1
"The latest Ghibli movie is a departure from their usual style, aimed at young children with a new animation style. Despite lacking depth, it is entertaining and endearing due to the honest plot and characters. The soundtrack is amazing and features a cute theme song.",1
"The movie ""Distant"" is a waste of time, with most scenes consisting of nothing happening and the camera seemingly left on to increase the length of the movie. The actors did a good job, but the story was lacking and there was nothing funny about it. It could have been condensed into a short film.",0
"The author suspects a distorted view of Patrice Lumumba, who is portrayed as a trouble-maker inciting violence. Lumumba's inability to control his people and his decision to seek Soviet help led to US involvement and his assassination. However, replacing him with Mobutu did not improve the situation. The film is well-acted, with great cinematography and music, and is recommended.",1
"Nurse Betty is a refreshing film that stands out from the disappointments of the summer. Director Neil LaBute showcases his ability to direct beyond disturbing sexual themes. Renee Zellweger delivers her best performance as Betty, a waitress who escapes into a fantasy world after witnessing her husband's death. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play hitmen on her trail, and the film cleverly portrays Freeman and Zellweger as parallel characters. Nurse Betty is a brilliant film that balances humor, love, and graphic violence.",1
"I am a big fan of Lynn Peterson since her breakthrough role in ""Far North"" in 1988. Her role as ""Driver"" in this movie is her strongest performance, but unfortunately, the movie doesn't have much else going for it. The editing to remove profanity for TV viewers is creative. I am looking for another Lynn Peterson poster.",0
"Romanian cinema is not well-known outside of Romania, with few directors gaining international attention. Lucian Pintilie is one of the few great directors in Romanian cinema, with his film 'Reconstituirea' being a reference for the industry. 'Furia' is a well-directed film about a lost generation dealing with the emergence of sub-culture and moral filth. It creates an emotional link between the characters and the viewer and could compete on the Western market. There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films to make its place in the international cinema scene. The film receives an 8/10 rating.",1
"""I consider 'Police Squad!' the funniest TV show of the 1980s and have all six episodes on BetaMax. ABC foolishly cancelled it, claiming viewers didn't realize it was a comedy without a laugh track. I've watched each episode at least ten times and always find new gags. If you haven't seen it, don't miss the chance, but you probably already have it if you're reading this.""",1
"The film is rated a 10 because it is compared to both similar films and the low quality of popular culture. It features a well-cast look at popular theater from the late 18th and early 20th centuries, with many of the plays involving a ""Chauncey Olcott Act."" The director, John Ford, also directed ""The Quiet Man,"" which is similar to ""My Wild Irish Rose."" The film has great songs and is enjoyable. The author is interested in learning more about Bill Scanlan, a former star who suffered from insanity and died in an asylum.",1
"I was thrilled to find it on the shelf, but was disappointed when I fell asleep while watching it. I tried again the next day, but still couldn't enjoy it. I'm a fan of the director's other work, but this one didn't work for me. However, I did appreciate the camera work.",0
"The writer had been hesitant to buy the film due to disappointment with the director's previous works and the fact that it had been edited for gore. However, after renting it, they found it to be a good imitation of ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" with an unsettling atmosphere and effective scares. The young cast was not as obnoxious as expected and George Kennedy's character added depth. The family in the woods is revealed to be hiding a dark secret, and the Ranger offers an explanation for their behavior. The film has some violence but not too much.",1
"I enjoyed watching Surface with my family and would like to see it return. The plot and storyline were excellent, but it seems that many shows today lack substance. The show had a large following and it was disappointing to be left hanging about the characters' fates. I also miss other shows like 8 Days and Greatest American Hero, which were cancelled for various reasons.",1
"Thursday is a crime film influenced by the 'new wave' of crime films popularized by Quentin Tarantino in the 90s. It follows the story of Casey, a former drug dealer turned architect, whose life takes a turn when his old partner in crime, Nick, shows up with drugs and stolen money. The film is set in a single location and features quirky characters that make it an amusing thriller. While it doesn't offer anything new cinematically or plot-wise, the film's dark humor and witty dialogue make it an enjoyable watch. The cast, led by Thomas Jane, delivers decent performances, making Thursday a fun movie with a few twists.",1
"Despite being born in 1994, the reviewer's childhood was heavily influenced by the 80s, with a preference for playing NES games like Zelda. The movie holds a special place in their heart due to their exposure to many TV shows and movies that other kids didn't see. The plot involves a race around the world with diamond smugglers tricking the children into delivering their diamonds. The film features great animation, top-notch voice acting, and kick-ass music, with the reviewer's favorite song being ""The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll."" The film has a happy ending, and the reviewer gives it a solid 10 out of 10.",1
"The movie ""Judge and Jury"" is poorly titled and has bad lighting. The killer, played by David Keith, is disguised well, but the movie is overall stupid. It is one of many recent ludicrous productions from Unapix and is a waste of time.",0
"The movie was interesting but had a disjointed plot. Despite this, the two main actors performed well, with Sean Penn stealing the show. He has since proven to be a versatile actor, displaying comedic talent in Sweet and Lowdown, which was unexpected. He is more talented than previously thought.",1
"Critics, some of whom are ordinary people, have praised the film Subconscius Cruelty as beautiful, but the author disagrees. They criticize the poor quality of the filming and the gratuitous depiction of extreme violence and sexual acts. The author warns readers not to waste their time on the film.",0
"The film is terrible, with poor acting and slow pacing, and lacks a clear purpose. The sex scenes are uncomfortable to watch and the overall quality is one of the worst I've seen.",0
"The first two hours of the TV version are mostly exposition, with the action starting in the second half. Some character relationships are only clear later on. The acting is competent, but not exceptional, except for Randy Quaid's annoying character. The plot is a mix of several disaster films, with predictable events and dialogue. The special effects are very poor, worse than those in ""CSI"" or ""Cold Case"". ""The Day After"", ""Asteroid"", or ""Special Bulletin"" are better options for made-for-TV disaster films with better plots, acting, and effects.",0
"SEA OF DUST won Best Picture at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival and features a quality feel with an original classical style musical score. The film follows a young doctor investigating strange events caused by a villain who views suffering as the key to establishing his version of the Kingdom of God on Earth. The movie includes a lot of blood, torture, and gore, as well as comedic moments. The director also explores the theme of religion being misused to back wars and killings. The film features stars like Savini and Pitt, a good supporting cast, and is an excellent independent film effort.",1
"""The Falcon and the Snowman"" is a true story about two disillusioned young men, a CIA employee and a drug dealer, who sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give convincing performances in the lead roles, with David Suchet delivering a notable performance as a Soviet agent. While the film effectively develops its premise, it can feel overlong and cumbersome at times. The ending is tense and effective, but the soundtrack includes some catchy rock songs and a mellow synthesizer track that doesn't fit with the spy story. Overall, ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" is a decent film, but there are better spy films to watch.",1
"As a romantic who enjoys musicals and comedy, this film was perfect. Julie Andrews delivers a captivating performance in the beginning and end, particularly in the ""Whistling in the Dark"" production number. Her hilarious and shocking performance in the middle of the film, when she suspects Rock Hudson of seeing a call girl, is sure to make you laugh. I wish this film was available on video or DVD so I could add it to my personal collection.",1
"The movie ""Finding Neverland"" simplifies and romanticizes the life of J.M. Barrie, leaving out important details such as the presence of Arthur Llewelyn Davies and the tragic deaths of several family members. The author criticizes Hollywood biopics for their formulaic approach and lack of complexity, and suggests that if Hollywood made a movie about anyone's life, it would be similarly oversimplified. Despite its flaws, the movie is likely to receive awards due to the Academy's tendency to reward familiar patterns. The reality of Barrie's life was much sadder than the movie portrays, with multiple deaths and tragedies.",0
"After seeing the trailer, I knew I had to watch ""The United States of Leland"". Although it doesn't have a happy ending, it leaves you with an empty feeling that allows you to reflect on the characters and society. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as Leland and the supporting cast, including Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle, is excellent. It's a smart and thought-provoking film that I highly recommend.",1
"I love Farscape because it offers a fresh take on older sci-fi styles and isn't afraid to have characters die. The show has heartwarming characters that grow on you, and it leaves you feeling a mix of hope and despair with unexpected twists. It's worth watching even if you're short on time.",1
"Initially expecting a romantic comedy, the writer rented ""Broadcast News"" under the comedy genre and was pleasantly surprised by the film's realistic script and talented cast. Despite the lack of a traditional happy ending, the truthful conclusion was appreciated and deemed genius. The film is considered a classic and a great romance movie. A rating of 9/10 was given.",1
"While watching TV, I discovered a captivating movie about the Burmese people's fight against a military dictatorship. The level of brutality used to maintain power was shocking, and it made me grateful to live in a country without such violence. The story of Laura Bowman helped tie the political struggle together.",1
"Franco's films can be categorized into four groups: ""earlies,"" ""naughties,"" ""nudies,"" and ""the rest."" This particular film falls under ""the rest"" category and is not a cannibal or gorefest movie. There is minimal full frontal nudity and the picture quality is poor. As a Franco fan, the reviewer suggests not wasting time on this film and doing something else instead.",0
"Pauly Shore fans will find the movie hilarious, but for others, it's a waste of talented actors. The plot involves a South Dakota coed inviting her California dorm counselor to Thanksgiving. Notable cast members include Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Mason Adams, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen. Be careful while watching.",0
"I knew Brad Linaweaver in college and thought he was a talented writer. However, after watching a video he made, it seems that he has not achieved the success I had hoped for. It is a sad reminder that chasing dreams without a solid foundation or goals can lead to neglect and deterioration.",0
"The adaptation of Gulliver's Travels has two parts: the ""now"" time where Gulliver is put into a mental asylum, and the ""described"" time where he describes his travels. The choppy tempo makes it difficult to suspend disbelief, and the ""now"" time adds nothing to the story. The CGI is well done, but many parts of the real travels are cut out. The first part is rated 0/10, and the actual travel coverage is rated 8/10, averaging out to a 4/10. The adapter may have added filler to keep costs down and produce a mini-series of a set length.",0
"Harold Lloyd, a comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage, incorporated sound gags in his ""silent"" films, but his sound features consistently failed at the box office due to the Great Depression and his perception as an insincere glad hander. His film, The Cat's-Paw, suffered due to its pro-fascist agenda and ill-timed release. The film posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and does so with good nature and fun. However, Lloyd should be credited for not making any further pro-fascist films and never selling The Cat's-Paw to television.",0
"To experience black filmmaking in the 70s, watch this film with funny dialogue, boom mic appearances, and great karate action. Approach it with an open mind and enjoy the world of Dolemite, but don't take it too seriously. Despite rough editing, the film has had a significant impact on the black community.",1
"The SyFy movie is better than most, but still not great. The plot involves a game made from a dead witch's bones and skin, which predicts the death of one of the players. The rest of the movie follows typical horror movie tropes, with a puzzle at the end and a subplot involving a cop who wants to use the game to bring back his family. Overall, it's messy.",0
"After watching ""Final Ascent"" by the same writer, I rented this video and was surprised by its intensity. I was captivated throughout and supported the teenagers in their crime. Although the ending was disturbing, it was well-executed. I strongly suggest watching this film.",1
"The movie has received mixed reviews, with those expecting a war movie giving it a low rating. It is an independent documentary about Gallipoli without bias, and those who appreciate this will find it moving and impressive. It does not have actors, gunfire, or gore.",1
"Despite high expectations from earlier reviews, the slow and basic plot of the story left the reader disappointed. The story follows a boy and girl who meet at a young age, both aspiring to be basketball legends. They grow apart but reunite in college, only to be separated again when the boy's father is caught cheating. The boy becomes a professional basketball player and dumps the girl, but they reunite years later after a basketball shootout. The story ends with the girl playing basketball and the boy taking care of their baby. The story received a low score from the reader and their partner.",0
"The writer enjoyed the book more than the popular Da Vinci Code and bought the DVD of the movie adaptation, but disliked Angels and Demons and will not watch it again. The film deviated significantly from the book, particularly in the events surrounding the discovery of the technology and the characters' relationships. The writer found the changes to be a mistake and the film to be one of the worst they have seen, causing them to lose feeling in their legs. They want a refund and are surprised that Ron Howard will continue to find work.",0
"Despite being a soft-core film with nonsensical dialogue and an extraneous plot, this movie has a hypnotic and pleasant mood due to its beautiful scenery, soft-focus nudity, and wonderful score. It is a rare and enjoyable example of filmmaking that is one of the author's ""guilty pleasures."" They have watched it numerous times on an old laserdisc.",1
"Many fail to grasp the true message of this film, which is about love and truth. It highlights the prevalence of insincere words in today's society, leading to high divorce rates. The film encourages following one's heart and fighting for what one believes in, even if commitment is not always enough. The ending is realistic, emphasizing the importance of not giving up on love.",1
"The Residents' music videos are abnormal and bizarre, but have great artistic value due to their thoughtful visuals and lighting. Icky Flix is a collection of their music videos ranging from rock to synthesized music with 80s horror film vibes. The videos are highly original and visually interesting, making them mini-classics for art film fans. The music is creepy and catchy, making the collection a near-perfect rating of four out of four stars and a runtime of 56 minutes.",1
"""Murder in the Music Hall"" is a forgotten Republic Picture that deserves more attention. The film is a well-produced and directed mystery-suspense set in Radio City Music Hall, with a murder casting suspicion on the Rockettes. William Marshall hunts down the killer in a complex and creepy plot, with a surprise ending. The film is worth restoring and reviving, as it is as enjoyable as any major studio film of its era. Pay attention to the victim's rhapsodic song to discover the killer. It is a loss that movies like this are no longer made.",1
"The film portrays an average family with a father who only cares about his son's swimming success, leaving his other children and wife ignored. A tragic event leads to drug use, partying, and a dark secret revealed by the mother. The film includes a mix of comedy and drama, as well as a homosexual scene.",1
"I enjoyed the movie almost as much as the original. The story of Scamp's desire for independence is relatable to most teenagers. The songs and character designs were good, and Lady and Tramp looked similar to the original. The voice actors did a good job, but I wish there were more lines for some characters. The scenery remained the same as the original film.",1
"Dr Steven Segal stars in a movie where he saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak. The film is unintentionally funny and has become a cult classic. Segal's character tries to portray himself as sensitive, a good father, a man of science, in tune with nature, politically correct, multicultural, an iconoclast, and an action hero. The movie is so bad that it's enjoyable to watch with friends, especially while intoxicated.",0
The writer misses the show Promised Land and wishes it had not been cancelled by CBS. They believe it was a great show for families and would like to see a reunion. They also ask if the show is available on DVD and if the last season was fully aired. The writer fondly remembers the show's opening theme song.,1
"The recently discovered series AN AGE OF KINGS can be viewed in excerpts on http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html, but it is not widely available. Its popularity is hindered by the existence of THE WARS OF THE ROSES, which has a similar cast and is more accessible. Despite their differences in dramaturgy, both series have strong casting.",1
"Ernesto and Manco make a living by deceiving people, but when they team up with the more experienced Federico, they become successful until Federico's former love interest appears. The Spanish film, directed by Miguel Bardem, is light-hearted and enjoyable, with some funny moments. Federico Luppi is a standout actor in the film, while Ernesto Alterio and Victoria Abril also deliver strong performances. Miguel Alexandre is also noteworthy as Manco.",1
"Despite being a novice in mountaineering, the reviewer found the film K2 to be unrealistic and lacking in accuracy. The climbers in the film perform miraculous feats of endurance without proper acclimatization and are barely out of breath. The reviewer suggests that the film may be enjoyable for those with no knowledge of mountaineering, but it is far removed from reality. The scenery is beautiful, but the storyline is clichéd and fantastical. The reviewer suspects that the filmmakers may have ignored expert advice in pursuit of a heroic storyline. Additionally, using the phrase ""welcome to the death zone"" at 200000 feet would be inappropriate.",0
"The standout feature of the movie was Kelly Overton's impressive acting, while the overall plot felt familiar. Despite this, the reviewer recommends the movie, particularly for Overton's performance, and rates it a 7 out of 10.",1
"The movie is impressive, but the script could have been improved with less cliched language. It references Joyce's ""The Dead"" and features stunning scenery and excellent acting, creating a poetic atmosphere. It is highly recommended.",1
The story follows a soldier who is transported to a desert town and recounts how he became separated from his unit while fighting in Egypt. He befriended a leopard and became almost feral before eventually leaving the animal. The film is well-written and features beautiful scenery from Jordan and Utah.,1
"Everyone agrees that the first season was the best, but killing off Boone and other characters was a bad decision made by the directors and writers. Despite this, the series is still the best sci-fi series ever. The quality of the series decreased after the first season, but Liam is an acceptable replacement for Boone. Lilli's exit from the story was undeserved, and Renee's character is lacking. The Taelons remain mysterious, and the conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are brilliant. Watching from the beginning is necessary to fully understand the show, but the acting, special effects, music, and plot are all great. It's a must-see.",1
"Lifeforce is a 1985 film directed by Tobe Hooper and funded by Cannon. It follows the story of two space vampires accidentally brought to Earth during a space shuttle mission. The film showcases the natural beauty of Mathilda May, who plays the title role. The film is well-directed and photographed, with plenty of gore effects for genre fans. Tobe Hooper made three interesting films for Cannon during this time period, including Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars. The film is highly recommended for fans of science fiction/horror films, Tobe Hooper, or Mathilda May.",1
"The film adaptation of Anne Rice's book is set in Australia and features stunning scenery. Lestat betrays his vampire oath and becomes a movie icon, causing his fellow vampires to plot his death. Jesse, an orphaned member of a supernatural studies group, becomes obsessed with Lestat and reads his diary, which reveals encounters with the Queen of the Damned. Akasha, the Queen, goes on a killing spree and tempts Lestat with royalty. The film has great fight scenes, music, and locations, and Aaliyah looked stunning on set. The reviewer gives the film a 10/10 rating and recommends it.",1
"This movie is like Top Gun but without the same level of animosity, class, money, or Tom Cruise. It features a cast of up-and-coming actors trying to prove their ability to lead a successful film, but ultimately falls short. The opening shot with Charlie Sheen shows promise, but is quickly ruined by a ridiculous wedding scene. Dennis Haysbert and Michael Biehn are decent in their roles, but Sheen never quite becomes an action hero. The movie receives a 3/10 rating.",0
"The movie ""Half Past Dead"" takes place in a prison that was once a tourist attraction and is now a mix of an airport and a junior high school. The plot follows an FBI agent who goes undercover in the prison to infiltrate a criminal organization. The movie is filled with poorly choreographed action sequences and ridiculous scenes, such as inmates playing basketball in the middle of a cell block. The only good scene is when Ja Rule's character gets slapped around by a little Asian woman. The movie received a PG-13 rating, which Roger Ebert criticized in comparison to the R rating given to the anti-gun movie ""Bowling for Columbine.""",0
"The writer expresses disappointment in NBC's decision to cancel Las Vegas, a show that had been excellent for five years. They criticize NBC's current programming, which includes uninteresting reality and game shows, and suggest that even Law and Order has become stale. The writer urges NBC to bring back Vegas and compares the network unfavorably to its past. They also suggest that CBS should consider picking up the show.",1
"The writer was initially worried about the Apocalypse film, as it had a lot to live up to after the success of the League of Gentlemen's stage show, radio show, and TV series. However, after seeing the film, the writer was blown away by its brilliance and attention to detail. The film works on many levels and is enjoyable for both casual and obsessive fans. The story moves at a swift pace and includes favorite characters from the show. The film is dark, a little scary, and a little strange, fitting for The League of Gentlemen. The in-jokes may puzzle some viewers, but there are plenty of clever references, wig jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes, and cock gags to keep everyone laughing. The cameos are genius, and the 1690s aspect of the film fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the film. The writer believes that The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse has set a new benchmark for British comedy films.",1
"Jack, Kate, and Locke's groups encounter new characters on the island, including a physician and psychics who reveal they are not there to rescue the survivors. Ben Linus shoots anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis, while Jack's group finds a pilot who can repair their damaged helicopter. The second episode of the fourth season marks a return to the island and the end of confusing flash-forwards, promising explanations for the government's interest in Ben Linus and how he is informed from the boat. The reviewer rates the episode an eight out of ten.",1
"The family's happiness crumbles when the wealthy father becomes poor and the mother becomes the breadwinner. The father disowns his gay son, causing his daughter to run away and his other son to enlist in the marines. The film portrays sensitive situations and is best suited for a mature audience.",1
"""The Great Dictator"" is Chaplin's first talkie and a decent satire on Hitler, but Chaplin's tendency to use excessive dialogue detracts from the film's potential brilliance. Despite this, Chaplin's performance in dual roles is memorable and Paulette Goddard is still worth watching. Jack Oakie's portrayal of a rival dictator is also noteworthy.",1
"I watched a Mexican TV show about a real-life murder case of an All American family. At first, it seemed like the son, Walker, was the killer due to his differences with his father, but things turned out differently during a lie detector test. Later, Luke inherited $200,000 and bought a convertible. Despite the name changes, the movie is a great mystery that explores betrayal, ambition, and cold-bloodedness. The acting, direction, and plot are all of high quality.",1
"This sequel is a prime example of bad sequels. It is worse than the first movie in every aspect, including the actors, scenario, and special effects. It is a terrible movie and receives a rating of 0.5 out of 5 stars, only for comedic value.",0
"This comedy portrays living next to a racist bigot and reveals that both main characters are equally flawed. Despite its lack of plot, the politically incorrect film based on the hit ITV comedy is highly entertaining. The cast, particularly Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker, work well together and the movie still elicits genuine laughter. It is recommended for fans of the genre.",1
"The show was similar to NIGHT STALKER and X-FILES in setting up improbable situations for the main characters to solve, but unlike those shows, the heroes had tangible results. The characters were in a dirty profession and occasionally had to do nasty things. The show was good at grabbing the viewer's attention and setting up unexpected yet sensible explanations. The character Anabelle was competent and stood up to the male leads. Sullivan was coldly efficient and ruthless, while King saw it as a game and used it for his detective/spy novels. The spin-off series featuring only King lacked the interest of the original.",1
"Despite differing opinions in the comments, the author enjoyed the film and believes that good directing involves following the subject and keeping the story and actors together. The main character is intentionally annoying and the film requires patience. The author appreciated the photography, sets, and acting, particularly Guillaume Depardieu's portrayal of a character who is playing a role. The film provides enough information on all characters and the strange building is likely a refuge for fighters in a civil war, hinted at by Isabelle's story and Pierre's book collection.",1
"Wes Craven's film ""Chiller"" is not up to par with his other works, which suffered after ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" His subsequent films were mediocre or worse until ""People Under the Stairs"" brought him back to form. ""Chiller"" lacks Craven's usual suspense and regular cast, with only one good scene involving an old man's heart attack on the stairs.",0
"This film is one of the funniest comedies of the 90s with great writing, a satisfying story, and an excellent cast, including Chris Farley at his best.",1
"Critics who initially criticized ""Tommy Boy"" should revisit the film and recognize its comedic value. While Chris Farley may not have been on the same level as John Belushi or John Candy, he was still very funny. The movie stands out from other Farley and Spade collaborations and is one of the best comedies of the 1990s. It is unfortunate that Farley is no longer with us, but ""Tommy Boy"" serves as a reminder of his comedic talent.",1
"Don't miss this timeless masterpiece, with exceptional script, music, choreography, casting, and editing. Available on DVD with perfect transfer and enhanced sound. Despite being almost 25 years old, it still impresses with its maturity, art, and sensitivity. The only mystery is why the actors didn't achieve greater success after this brilliant start.",1
"This horror film is a masterpiece with zombies, grave snatching, and a great cast. The American actors with Irish/English accents were convincing, especially Larry Fessenden who was excellent in his role. The film is set in early 19th century Europe and is well crafted. It's highly recommended for a great time.",1
"While looking for something to watch during lunch, I stumbled upon a movie on the WE Network about a gymnastics team. I missed the beginning but caught up quickly, including a scene where Crystal admits to feeling responsible for her rapist's death. Despite enjoying Jenny Garth's performance, I felt bad for the actors due to the poorly written script. The wardrobe was also inaccurate, with outfits from the wrong time period. Overall, the movie is good for a laugh or for fans of Garth.",0
"The cinematic version of Carmen by Spanish director Vicente Aranda provides a more complete telling of the story of the wild gypsy girl created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845. The film follows the tempestuous Carmen, played by Paz Vega, and her doomed lover José, played by Leonardo Sbaraglia, as their passionate bond is tested by various incidents, including Carmen's affair with a bullfighter and the return of her real husband from prison. The incorporation of Mérimée as a main character adds depth to the story. The film features superb acting, cinematography, and musical score, making it a must-see for opera lovers and historical drama enthusiasts.",1
"The movie ""Fame"" is enjoyable because it allows us to imagine ourselves as music, dance, and drama students expressing ourselves. It is humorous and entertaining, and can inspire young people to pursue the performing arts. Overall, it deserves an 8 out of 10 rating.",1
"The movie is not a masterpiece, but it is entertaining and has aged with the times. The reviewer enjoyed it and found the acting average but suspenseful. Sandra Bullock's character as a computer genius was attractive. The reviewer's favorite movie of 1995, with a rating of 9/10.",1
"Emilio Estevez directs an engaging movie adaptation of the play HOMEFRONT with an exceptionally strong cast and top-notch acting. The smooth visual transitions and chilling sound effects add to the tension. The story's interesting characters and family dynamics remain even without the Viet Nam elements. THE WAR AT HOME is more direct than BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY and a fine effort, almost a 10.",1
"Despite altering reality for entertainment purposes, the film about Custer featuring Errol Flynn is the best one made. The music by Max Steiner is superb and the use of Custer's favorite song adds to the authenticity. The film could benefit from more villains, but the chemistry between Flynn and De Havilland is unmatched. Director Raoul Walsh excels in outdoor scenes with large casts.",1
"I expected a bad movie, but ""Blurred"" pleasantly surprised me. It's a relatable teen movie that reminded me of my own school experiences. Watching these types of movies can be entertaining and nostalgic, and can also help us understand our children better. I recommend giving this movie a try.",1
"The CKY crew consistently creates brilliant and foolish content, with Haggard being a prime example of comedic excellence despite its nonsensical nature. It's a must-have for fans of CKY and Jackass.",1
"Despite its preachy PC storyline about rape, this film has suspenseful moments and a standout performance from Ms. Beller. The plot drags on after the climax, but fans of 70s high school melodrama or Beller will enjoy it.",1
"The movie's first 10 minutes mock sequels and pg-13 movies, which are the main reasons for its poor quality. The film frequently references a movie called ""Get Leo,"" a movie-in-a-movie version of ""Get Shorty,"" which is frustrating. Travolta and Keitel are not cool, but The Rock and Vince Vaughn are funny, although not in the typical Elmore Leonard style. If you haven't seen ""Get Shorty,"" you may enjoy ""Be Cool,"" but if you have, you'll likely leave the theater angry at the director and screenwriter. It's best to wait for the DVD.",0
"Anthony Wong, known for his roles as a psychopathic weirdo in CATIII films, plays a man who seeks out a sorcerer for good dreams in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. However, the dreams come at a price and the sorcerer manipulates them to blackmail Wong and eventually kill him and his family. Wong's brother seeks revenge and with the help of the sorcerer's abused wife, turns the tables on the sorcerer. EROTIC NIGHTMARE is a more enjoyable and ""fun"" CATIII film compared to others in the genre, with plenty of nudity and gore. It is recommended for genre enthusiasts.",1
"Family Guy is a popular show that relies on irrelevant idiocy and repetitive jokes about sexual deviancy. Despite being praised for its edgy humor, it is actually dull, insulting, and uninspired. The show's attempts at being ""un-PC"" are not as daring as they claim to be. While it had some good moments, it is time for the show to end. The author still prefers it to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.",0
"Despite my anticipation of seeing two talented young actors in ""Dear John,"" the film was slow and hindered the lead performers due to the screenplay and direction. However, the movie did effectively portray realistic military action and the cinematography skillfully transitioned through love letters. Channing Tatum's performance was weighed down by a constant expression of sadness.",0
"The movie is set in London and is fantastic. It will be available on DVD in April 2003, and I plan to purchase it. The soundtrack, created by Saint Etienne, is exceptional.",1
"This adventure mini-series is top-notch and highly recommended. Sigrid's portrayal of Philadelphia is convincing and the production is excellent. It's worth watching all 400 minutes. Although I can't officially rate it, I give it a solid 10.",1
"WDR aired ""The General"" and ODC. ""The General"" was okay, but not great. ODC, starring Kevin Spacey, was confusing and lacked coherence. It tried to be cool like Guy Ritchie's films, but fell short. Overall, I would rate it 3 out of 10.",0
"The author was intrigued by Haneke as a filmmaker after reviewing Cache, which led them to watch La Pianiste. The film portrays a severely emotionally crippled character who represses her sexuality and struggles for autonomy. The bathroom scene is not erotic due to the prior scene revealing the character's disturbed nature. The film's ending is not neatly wrapped up, but there is a sense of finality. The author is now more intrigued by Haneke after watching La Pianiste.",1
"Canthony is right that the short film is only valuable for showcasing a young Judy Garland singing with Deanna Durbin. However, the running time is only ten minutes, not twenty. Despite the song not being Garland's best, the duet with Durbin is intriguing. The short is not great, but it is not as terrible as the other reviewer claimed. Overall, the author enjoyed it.",1
"The 1935 version of ""Enchanted April"" is both tedious and perfunctory, lacking the transformative magic of Italy and relying on stereotypical Italian behavior. The characters' transformation is sudden and underdeveloped, and the husbands are uninteresting. Jessie Ralph and Katharine Alexander give enjoyable performances, while Ann Harding is unremarkable due to the Production Code.",0
"The film accurately depicts the music industry and Harvey Keitel's performance as a producer torn between artistic integrity and commercial pressure is excellent. As someone who worked in the music industry, I can attest to its authenticity. I would purchase the uncut DVD if it became available.",1
"As someone with cerebral palsy, the reviewer doesn't want to give the film a free pass just because it tackles a rarely approached subject. They had minor issues with the film, such as unashamedly crowd-pleasing scenes and the late introduction of a terminal illness. However, the script also tackled tricky issues and showed daily apparatus used by non able-bodied people. The film is less sappy than expected and the interaction between the actors is special. The reviewer is happy that the film does justice to the lust for life of many disabled persons.",1
"The successful television show ""Doctor Who"" has returned with new episodes. The first two episodes, ""Rose"" and ""The End of the World,"" introduce the main character, Rose, who is saved by the Doctor from remote-controlled mannequins. They team up to save the world from plastic monsters and Rose decides to join the Doctor on his travels. Despite some weak special effects and choppy scenes, the show is well-written and predicted to be successful in the US.",1
"As a retired medical professional, I enjoy watching the film ""Hospital"" repeatedly. Paddy Chayefsky, a friend of my college composition teacher, visited our class in 1958 and his writing remains timeless. The supporting cast members went on to successful careers in TV and film. George Scott's comedic timing is comparable to Jackie Gleason and Steve Martin, and the film's humor is mental rather than physical. Despite containing only one four-letter word, it is still a family-friendly film.",1
"I frequently watch this film on TV, but forget to record it. Despite knowing the script, I still cry and enjoy the well-made, well-cast, and well-photographed film. It's one of my top ten favorites.",1
"I enjoyed the movie, which initially seemed like a typical French art film but then unexpectedly shifted into two separate plots. The twist was impressive, but the ending was confusing. The film was well-shot.",1
"After reading negative reviews, the author watched Mind of Mencia and found the criticisms to be accurate. The show relies on tired stereotypes and recycled jokes, including a rip-off of Jeff Foxworthy's ""You might be a redneck if..."" bit. The author suggests avoiding the show and instead watching comedians like Dave Chappelle who offer insightful humor about race and racism.",0
"Both parts of IVAN THE TERRIBLE were listed in the 50 Worst Movies book, but the second part is an improvement. The films were commissioned by Stalin to glorify him and excuse his reign, but even he didn't like them. The story of Ivan's life is incomplete, and the films feature overacting and long, boring scenes. However, there is one cool scene with Prince Vladimir at a banquet that is well-done and funny. The film uses a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor, which is odd for the 1940s.",0
"This is an excellent horror movie with a captivating story and a terrifying villain in Captain Howdy. The film is unique in that the villain becomes the hero, blurring the lines between good and evil. The two acts of the movie work well together and it is highly recommended for horror fans.",1
"Emilio is a successful businessman, father, and husband, but his carefully crafted facade begins to crumble. The film explores our fears about truly knowing those around us. The story builds tension as Emilio loses control of his lies. The technical proficiency and well-shot scenes make the actors believable, drawing the audience into Emilio's situation. The film is a realistic portrayal of Spain in 2002 and prompts viewers to consider the consequences of lies.",1
"By chance, the author discovered a TV show during a storm and ended up watching all the episodes. The cast, including John Hannah and Gerard Murphy, were excellent. The only downside was the limited number of episodes, and the author hopes to see the show return with John Hannah.",1
"The unexpected plot twist made me review the scenes for hints. I enjoyed the impressive performances of Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett, as well as the captivating story and haunting music.",1
"Brian Foster creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. for his boss, whose home security business is failing. A rival company hires two criminals to steal C.H.O.M.P.S., but they struggle to do so. The film is directed with a lighthearted tone and features a talented cast, including Valerie Bertinelli and Red Buttons. The titular pooch is a lovable character who performs impressive feats. The film also includes a subplot about a neighborhood dog named Monster. The opening credits, cinematography, and score are all well done. Overall, it is a cute children's movie.",1
"Ellen Gulden is the only convincing and likable character in the movie, with the exception of a sympathetic woman and the DA. However, the plot turns against itself by making the dying mother the ""one true thing"" in the eyes of her weak-willed husband. The one powerful scene where Ellen confronts her father's cruelty is undermined at the end, making the movie a bore and not worth watching.",0
"Peter Cushing's performance enhances this classic midnight movie with corny sci-fi elements. The sound design, including the choppy voices of creatures and rhino creatures, creates a strange atmosphere, complemented by the presence of a scantily clad woman.",1
The film about Stu Ungar is a tragedy in filmmaking history and is not recommended unless you have a specific interest in his life. It trivializes important parts and is unpleasant to watch.,0
"Although I am a fan of Steven Seagal, I did not understand the plot of this movie and was confused about the characters' allegiances. I hope his future films are more comprehensible. Nonetheless, my wife still finds him attractive in black jeans.",0
"ENCHANTED APRIL has a great story idea about two unhappy wives renting an Italian villa with two strangers, but the film is ruined by two bad performances. Ann Harding's portrayal is ridiculous and Reginald Owen's character is obnoxious and unbelievable. Despite the good plot and ambiance, these performances cannot be overlooked and undermine the rest of the film. A re-make is needed.",0
"The film is well-crafted with excellent cinematography and use of color. The director's work is fantastic and adds depth to the picture. The acting is suitable but the story lacks coherence and flow at times. Despite this, the film is recommended for its vision, visual flourish, and dark humor.",1
"The movie was mistakenly identified as being filmed in Russia, but it was actually filmed in Bulgaria. The author believes that American movies filmed in Bulgaria are generally of poor quality, including this one featuring Patrick Swayze. The movie lacks plot twists and energy, and is considered weak and boring.",0
"""The Man"" is a film about a boarding-house owner who takes in a troubled handyman who may be dangerous. Despite good performances from Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan, the film is unoriginal and visually dull with a small cast of characters. The direction is stilted and the film lacks the promised suspense. The screenplay was adapted by Mel Dinelli, who also co-produced the film.",0
"This story conveys multiple messages about success, failure, choices, self-realization, and determination. Each scene contains an element that stimulates the imagination. The sexually suggestive scenes are only meant to entertain and distract from character development.",1
"On New Year's Eve, a dying nurse requests to see David Holm, who is celebrating with his drunken friends in a cemetery. Holm tells a ghost story about a man who died on New Year's Eve and was condemned to drive Death's phantom chariot for a year. Ironically, Holm dies at midnight and witnesses the arrival of the phantom carriage and its driver, who turns out to be the man from his story. The film's special effects, including double-exposure photography, are impressive for its time. 'Körkarlen' is a haunting portrayal of Holm's descent into alcoholism, his judgment, and a possibility of redemption.",1
"Most posts on this site give a 10-star rating and rarely express dislike. However, the author is honest and dislikes the Rachel Ray show, finding it uninteresting and annoying. They prefer shows like ""Ham on the Street"" and Anthony Bourdain's work. The author also mentions that Rachel Ray has been cancelled.",0
"The author remembers a series of films from the 80s called ""Not Quite Human"" about a robot disguised as a human. They recommend watching the series if possible and ask if it has been shown recently.",1
"The movie is only 72 minutes long and if you can't figure out who the killer is, you haven't been paying attention to slasher movies for the past 20 years. Also, why is it that the non-nude actor is always the one people want to see naked?",0
"The film begins with a boat holiday, a married couple, an angry waiter, and a shipwreck. The main character's behavior of having sex with whoever has the most fish and playing the victim is frustrating. The movie involves a husband, another man, and a woman on a deserted island with moral issues and arguments. The acting is good, but the lack of moral values in the female character is sickening. The recommendation is to watch the movie to make other films seem more enjoyable.",0
"The film is highly enjoyable with great cameos, drug references, and music. The Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, containing the original 6 HBO episodes, should be rented before seeing the film in theaters to fully appreciate the inside jokes.",1
"The movie seen on TNT was initially corny and cheesy, but it turned out to be more of a comedy than an action/adventure. The most hilarious scene involved Kennedy shooting flares out the window to avoid missiles, but the flare gun malfunctioned and caused chaos. The movie lacked a plot and had too many love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. The final rating for the movie is 1 out of 10 stars if it were an action movie and 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy.",0
"Sharpe's Honour is the fifth installment in a TV movie series based on Bernard Cornwell's books about an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars. The story focuses on espionage, with Sharpe being falsely accused of murder and going on a secret mission to clear his name. The episode takes a more adventure-style approach, with Sharpe dodging French patrols and getting involved in daring escapes. The episode is a strong addition to the series, but not the best introduction for new viewers.",1
"As a huge Tolkien fan, the reviewer bases their critique of the movie on his books. While the movie is well-made with impressive effects and acting, it deviates too much from the original story and lacks character depth. The reviewer rates it 7+ / 10 as an adventure movie, but only 2 / 10 as an adaptation of Tolkien. They suggest that Peter Jackson should have labeled it as an adventure movie based on the Lord of the Rings.",0
"This film is terrible and the worst I've ever seen. Don't waste your time or money watching it. I rated it 1/10, which is too generous.",0
"The Hookers is a relatable story about everyday people trying to succeed, but facing temptations that can lead to setbacks. The author enjoyed the movie and even had a small role in it, playing the drums and showcasing their green Corvette. The cast and crew were wonderful, including James Coburn and Slim Pickens, who were down-to-earth and memorable. The author appreciates the film's focus on real people and thanks the filmmakers.",1
"In Sweden, a dying Salvation Army sister requests to see David Holm, but he cannot be found as he is spending New Year's Eve in a graveyard with his drinking buddies. In the graveyard, Holm tells the story of ""The Phantom Carriage"". The film, directed by Sjöström and photographed by Jaenzon, uses the ""double exposure"" effect effectively and has memorable dramatic highlights. However, the ending is a letdown and it is difficult to suspend disbelief in the story. Starring Sjöström, Borgström, and Svennberg.",1
"The Jazz Singer is one of several films made in the late 1940s and 1950s about the Jewish experience in the United States, often with a musical-theatre background. Non-Jewish actors were typically cast in leading roles to make the Jewish theme more accessible to non-Jewish audiences. The film follows a cantor's son who must choose between continuing the family tradition or pursuing a career in musical theatre, leading to conflict with his father. The film also portrays Jews as quintessentially American and loyal citizens, with no Eastern European accents. Peggy Lee's performance is noteworthy, and while the film is sentimental, it is worth watching.",1
"""Prime Suspect 4"" is a miniseries that follows Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison as she faces personal and professional challenges while seeking justice for victims. The series consists of three miniseries, with the absence of writer Lynda La Plante. Tennison battles both evil and good forces, making the scenarios of the series even grayer and her wars a matter of principle. The series improves with each installment. (B+)",1
"Many classic movies portrayed leading characters as liars, but the writer did not find this appealing, particularly in screwball comedies and Fred Astaire films. In this film, Barbara Stanwyck plays a magazine writer who lies to maintain her public persona and job, even about getting married. She pretends to be skilled in cooking and childcare, but her lies accumulate quickly. The writer finds the film unfunny, preferring Stanwyck's performances in film noir, and does not think highly of Dennis Morgan's acting.",0
"The writer is intrigued by ninjitsu and enjoyed the movie ""Ninja III"", which features a ninja seeking revenge through a possessed woman named Christie. Another ninja named Yamada comes to America to save Christie and put the vengeful ninja to rest. The fight scenes were impressive and the movie is recommended for martial arts enthusiasts. The writer gives it a 3 out of 5 stars.",1
"Initially, I did not plan to review this movie. However, while searching for the lead actor's name, I stumbled upon reviews and read them. Unfortunately, this movie is terrible, and I cannot fathom how anyone could enjoy it. The talented cast, including Caine, Gelbart, and Donen, were wasted, making it a cause for mourning rather than a guilty pleasure. It was a low point for everyone involved, except for Bologna, who may be trying to figure out which bomb ruined his career.",0
"This movie is enjoyable and funny, but avoid the TV version as it cuts out too much. Dom Deluise is great as the mafia Don hired to kill Robin. The rappers at the beginning and end are outdated and the songs are lame. Overall, it's a must-watch for comedy fans.",1
"Al Pacino used to act without relying on profanity, but now Matthew McConaughey has followed in his footsteps. However, this behavior is not acceptable in polite society and is seen as a lack of intelligence and disrespect. The movie they starred in was not good, and it is suggested that Pacino should take acting classes again. Rene Russo was the only standout performance.",0
"Despite recommendations and positive comments, the film purchased on eBay was disappointing due to average acting, poor editing, and lack of brilliance from director Wes Craven. While there were some creepy moments and effective music, overall the film was not great.",0
"Michelle Pfeiffer plays a mob widow in a colorful black comedy, with Matthew Modine as a clumsy FBI agent who likes her. Dean Stockwell is the standout as a persistent big shot, and Mercedes Ruehl is excellent as his jealous wife. The film has an eighties vibe, making it enjoyable, but it may not be for everyone.",1
"The writer has mixed feelings about the updated version of ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" compared to the original. While the new version lacks the same horror edge, it has some good aspects and is still enjoyable to watch. The first part of the movie is comedic and introduces the lead actress, Julie Delpy. The horror scenes are well done, and the lack of profanity is appreciated, but there are sexual remarks and a blasphemous scene. The heavy metal soundtrack may not appeal to older viewers, as the film is geared towards a younger audience. Overall, it's entertaining but not as good as the first film.",1
"The film lacked plot, action, suspense, drama, and scenery, but was still wonderful due to its understated nature, perfect acting, script, and casting. The reviewer plans to watch it again and recommends it to others. They give it a 9 out of 10.",1
The movie had good messages for kids but was predictable. The book had more plot details and humor. It may be too slow for kids under 6. The casting of Jimmy Buffet and the baby owls were highlights. The movie showcased Florida well. The author may have made a brief appearance.,1
"This film is so bad that no spoilers could make it worse. It is described as puerile and includes disgusting elements like dog poo and mucous. The cast, including Johnny Vegas, made a poor decision in participating.",0
"This film showcases the talents of many black performers, some of whom have passed away, and allows us to appreciate their abilities. It is a valuable historical document and belongs to the people of this country due to its educational value. The sound and quality of the film are good, and there are no negative views. The reviewer requests that the movie be made available to everyone for its historical significance.",1
"The movie was enjoyable, but despite being a mystery fan, I couldn't guess the killer. The Gerda character's portrayal was not ideal, but it may have been accurate for the time period. The Poirot movies lack the same dynamic as the series without Japp, Ms. Lemon, and Hastings. David Suchet is the best Poirot actor, while Peter Ustinov was the worst.",1
"The film is a high budget production by Paramount that follows the story of Jack Shepard, a locksmith turned highwayman in 1700's London. After being double-crossed, he becomes a Robin Hood figure and gains the support of the common folk. The film was shot in Ireland and captures the bustling atmosphere of London in the 1700's. It shows the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived. Although lacking in political commentary, the film is enjoyable and deserves a viewing. It has not been released on video or DVD.",1
"House of the Dead 2 fails to meet the basic requirements of a good zombie movie, lacking in special effects, gore, scares, and plot. The dialogue is infamous and the special effects are embarrassing. The movie was filmed on a low budget and the female soldiers are all models. The characters are clueless and allow the zombies to kill them. This movie is worse than even the worst Scifi Channel movies.",0
"If you appreciate visual arts, you will enjoy this great movie. The two daughters' painted and photographed scenery is stunning, and the story is both humorous and touching. It is an art movie that will appeal to fans of European and art films. Rent it now.",1
"Raymar, a lethal telekinetic psychic vampire, dies under strange circumstances. Julie Wells, a high school student, wants to be accepted by a snobby clique and agrees to spend a night in a mausoleum where Raymar's body is interred. Raymar still has his powers, making it a terrifying night for Julie. The film creates an eerie atmosphere but is slow and uneventful in the first hour. Despite its flaws, the film has endearing 80s charm, impressive cinematography, makeup effects, and a macabre finale.",1
"Commander's Log is a low-budget science fiction show that was presented at a local convention by Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks, and Brian Oberquell. The show is compared to Red Dwarf and relies on good writing and acting due to its lack of ""eye candy"". Originally intended to be shown in two-minute interstitials, the show was instead aired as a one-hour program in two half-hour episodes. The existing DVD does not include episodes 3 and 4, but screenings may be available through the fannish community.",1
"The paragraph describes a movie that combines elements of Christ mythology, pornography, bad sci-fi, blackxploitation, after school specials, kung fu fighting, and break dancing, with a Casio keyboard soundtrack. The movie includes multiple rape scenes, a car explosion, and a buff black man running around in his underwear with an Uzi. The author suggests that the movie is so bad that it can only be enjoyed with copious amounts of alcohol.",0
"John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film is a masterful blend of the body-swap theme and Cold-War paranoia, set in the isolated Antarctic. Carpenter's direction is excellent, with surreal gore and special effects, while still maintaining the human element of trust and suspicion. It is a remake of the 1951 original produced by Howard Hawks. The film is rated 9/10.",1
"As a former Marine, I can confirm that the movie D.I. accurately portrays Marine boot camp and the transformation of boys into men. Jack Webb plays the role of Sgt. Jim Moore, a strict but just drill instructor in Paris Island, North Carolina. The film focuses on a recruit who struggles to adapt. Another recommended film that depicts basic training is Full Metal Jacket.",1
Lynch's failed TV pilot was completed with a mix of everything and lacks a deeper meaning. The concept of building up a mystery and then revealing nothing is repeated in Lynch's work. The audience's serious discussion of a comedian's nonsensical opera performance is similar to the deeper meaning search for Lynch's work. The movie has a 0/10 rating.,0
"Companies in Romania are only taking pictures of old cars and not the newer, more expensive ones. They are also filming in neighborhoods where they can manipulate the environment and dress people in outdated clothing to make them look foolish. The author wishes for future movies to be made in the US instead of Romania to avoid embarrassment for the country.",0
"'National Velvet (1944)' is a heartwarming story with a good moral, despite occasional unconvincing moments. Elizabeth Taylor's acting abilities were limited at age 12, but she works well with Mickey Rooney. The film effectively captures the nervous tension of the Grand National Sweepstakes race sequence. The positive message of the film has inspired millions of young girls over the last sixty years.",1
"Wayne Wang's direction and the chemistry between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman make this film more impressive than ""Slums of Beverly Hills"". The dysfunctional life of the two women is portrayed without causing depressed frustration. Susan Sarandon's character is a narcissistic parent who manages to avoid being floridly insane or intentionally sadistic. Natalie Portman's character is an intelligent codependent child with dignity under stress. The film has a satisfying resolution and is recommended for those who want to be challenged and entertained.",1
"""National Velvet"" is a film about a young English girl, Velvet Brown, who dreams of entering her horse into the Grand National race. With the help of a former jockey and her parents, she trains her horse for the competition. The film appeals to the entire family and received five Oscar nominations, including a win for Anne Revere's performance as Velvet's mother. Elizabeth Taylor, at 12 years old, steals the show with her charming presence and talent beyond her years. The film's Technicolor and editing are attractive, and it was also nominated for direction, cinematography, and art direction. The score by Herbert Stothart is noteworthy. Despite the subject matter, ""National Velvet"" is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating.",1
"""Late Chrysanthemums"" is a character-driven film by Mikio Naruse that follows the lives of three ex-geishas in post-war Japan. The women's strained relationship is complicated by one woman's success as a moneylender, while the other two rely on their children for income. The film is slow-moving, but Naruse's ability to do much with very little makes it a worthwhile watch. Despite its cynicism, Naruse sympathizes with his characters and paints vivid portraits of their self-made misery. The film is important as a fragment of the work of a great but little-known director.",1
"I enjoyed the Millenium series and bought the film, but it was a mistake as it is a typical bad mutant/monster movie. The idea is not completely unsuccessful, but the execution makes it a B-class movie. The scary scenes are more comical and the creature is not believable. However, watching it with friends in a playful mood makes it unintentionally funny.",0
"The media's portrayal of ""lesbian"" movies is disappointing, often featuring negative stereotypes. However, FINGERSMITH stands out as a well-acted and believable love story with engaging conflict. It surpasses TIPPING THE VELVET in character development and acting quality, and is a satisfying and enjoyable watch for lesbians, following in the footsteps of BOUND.",1
"The film adaptation of John Irving's novel, starring Robin Williams, attempts to depict a man's growth from birth to adulthood and his struggles with lust and fanaticism. However, the film's quirky and bittersweet sketches end up being absurd, and Williams' talent is wasted on a script that doesn't suit his wildness and anarchy. The movie attracted attention in 1982 due to Williams' popularity, but audiences were confused by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.",0
"Despite recognizing Jennifer Lynch's name and the 18 certificate, I found the film to be a farce with atrocious acting and a bad script. The little girl character named Stephanie gave the best performance, but overall, the film is violent without point and plain silly. I cannot recommend it to anyone.",0
"I expected to rate this movie poorly, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Despite tacky characters, cheap effects, and unimpressive monsters, I found it somewhat entertaining, possibly due to its humor. It's worth a three-star rating.",0
"The young age of director and script writer Dan Harris must be considered when evaluating 'Imaginary Heroes', but the film is a mature and professional work with some routine flaws. The story revolves around a family coping with the suicide of their talented son and brother, portrayed by Emile Hirsch. Sigourney Weaver plays the mother and both actors deliver excellent performances. The tension builds in the first two sections of the film, but the second part is disappointing and conventional, possibly due to producer interference. Despite this, Harris shows promise and is likely to make a name for himself in the future.",1
"Heather Graham is not only beautiful but also entertaining to watch in this movie, which features a great cast that works well together. Casey Affleck is funny, and Heather Graham shines on screen. The supporting actors, Goran Visnjic and Patricia Velazquez, are both talented and attractive. Miramax and Director Lisa Krueger deserve congratulations.",1
"This film has elements reminiscent of Bunuel, but fails to hold one's attention. A 10-year-old drives a stolen Mustang through a strange America, while familiar cult movie actors engage in comedic acts of malice. The screenwriter, known for uncomfortable films like AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, enjoys making audiences squirm, but the exaggerated acting left me unimpressed. Even Meat Loaf and Flea's performances were more appealing than the insufferable child actor. This movie is only recommended for fans of SONNY BOY ('87).",0
"Terry and June is a classic British sitcom that stands out from modern shows with contrived plots and dysfunctional families. It features a middle-class couple living in relative harmony, and is a breath of fresh air compared to shows that rely on bodily function jokes and perpetually late families. The ""Bridge to far"" episode is particularly good, with Terry's antics reminiscent of Basil Fawlty. Highly recommended for a cozy viewing experience with tea and biscuits.",1
"Ms. Stowe delivers a remarkable performance in a powerful drama where a secret policeman interrogates a children's author for allegedly planting anti-state ideas in her writing. The film's message and both performances deserve more recognition, making it a must-see if available.",1
"I was hesitant to watch Blade due to disappointment with previous comic book movies. However, Blade exceeded my expectations with its accurate portrayal of the story, violence, martial arts, and good vs. evil theme. The film was well-made and never boring. Blade II was good, but not as good as the first. Overall, Blade is one of the best comic book movies I've seen in a while.",1
"The movie is disliked, but better than its sequels. The humor and relationship development are repetitive. The setting in South Africa is unrealistic. Hollywood repeats itself with similar storylines. The action scenes are over the top and the plot is predictable. The movie receives a 3/10 rating.",0
"Lucasarts has once again produced an excellent game, proving their dominance in the gaming genre. Concerns about the game's ability to maintain its humor were quickly dispelled upon playing. The game is filled with jokes from start to finish and lives up to the high standards set by previous Lucasarts works. It is highly recommended.",1
"Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty (2000) marks his transition from indie to mainstream cinema, while still maintaining his unique style. The film features A-list Hollywood actors, but the material remains quirky and bizarre. The story follows a naive waitress who falls in love with a soap star and sets out to meet him after her husband is murdered by hitmen. The film is a dark comedy and one of the most absurd movies in recent years. LaBute's recurring theme of vulnerable women being taken advantage of is present, but he deals more harshly with the abusers. The supporting cast includes Crispin Glover, Allison Janney, and Kathleen Wilhoite. The script is over-the-top, and the ending may be too perfect, but the film is still great.",1
"The movie is a bad adaptation of a great book, which I highly recommend for children, but I cannot recommend the movie.",0
"As a central European, I find the show comparable to Married with Children and believe it is not suitable for conservative audiences. Despite my own conservative views, I appreciate the humor and moral lessons in the show. It is unfortunate that there are only two seasons and I hope it continues. Unlike other comedies, there are no sad or unfunny moments in the show, making it similar to The Simpsons and Married with Children.",1
"Irwin Allen wrote, produced, and directed a cartoonish ""epic"" about an atomic submarine trying to reduce a ring of radiation around the Earth. Despite an interesting cast, the potentially exciting story falls flat and the sci-fi is cheesy. It provides a few laughs but lacks strong adventure. It later became a popular TV series.",0
"The movie has appealing characters, great animation, catchy songs, and adorable cats. It is humorous without any threatening elements, making it suitable for children. The two farm dogs are memorable despite their limited screen time. The linear style of the artwork may not be for everyone, but it is charming to the reviewer.",1
"The message of the film is that irrational hatred is a waste of life, as demonstrated by Fred's actions towards Lawrence. The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein highlights the consequences of bigotry. The film's details, such as the propaganda poster and graffiti, also convey important messages. The film should be included in school curriculums to combat the promotion of baseless hatred.",1
"""Campfire Tales"" is a horror anthology film consisting of three spooky stories told by a group of friends who get into a car crash in the woods after a concert. As they wait for help, they tell classic horror stories that become increasingly terrifying. The last story is the scariest, with a twist ending. The film is worth watching and better than expected, with recognizable cast members. Overall, it's a great anthology of classic urban legends.",1
"Despite enjoying Neil Gaiman's writing in the past, Mirrormask was a disappointment. While the live-action section was intriguing and well-done, the subsequent computer-generated scenes were awkward and lacked plot coherence. It is recommended to stick with Gaiman's written work instead.",0
"This movie differs from others about the death penalty by emphasizing the suffering of victims' parents and presenting a Christian perspective. The convicted man is not portrayed as innocent, and the emotional weight of the execution is highlighted through parallel cuts with murder scenes. The movie suggests that legal executions are no different from murder.",1
"The film ""Punishment Park"" was unexpectedly discovered and initially believed to be a real documentary, causing a strong emotional reaction. It felt very realistic and led to negative feelings towards America, until it was later discovered to be a work of fiction.",1
"The movie, produced by Bey, has an international feel and was filmed in Vienna. Bey was great in Universal adventure movies and in a thrilling movie called ""The Amazing Mr. X."" However, this movie is wooden and difficult to follow, with a disappointing plot. Lederer looks great as a concert pianist but the movie is heavy going.",0
"The short film features a harsh writing teacher whose blunt criticism affects his personal life, but he eventually learns the importance of diplomacy and gains insight into the art of writing.",1
"Sean Connery plays the Great Raisuli in an adventure movie featuring Arabs, Germans, and the USMC. The story is based on a true incident of a kidnapping, but the victims have been changed to Candace Bergen and her children. The movie includes humor and famous political quotations from the TR era. Brian Keith says ""Pedecaris alive or the Raisuli dead!"" and John Huston asks the Japanese Ambassador, ""You likee knifee, you likee forkee?"" at a White House dinner.",1
"This movie is perfect for summer and despite being silly and outdated, it still made my kids laugh. It follows the typical plot of the underdogs fighting against the establishment, making it predictable but enjoyable. Although Bill Murray is not at his best, it was his first leading role and he shows potential. Surprisingly, few of the young actors in the film went on to have successful careers.",1
"The Greatest Game Ever Played is a film about Francis Ouimet, a 20-year-old son of an immigrant family living in the United States during the late 19th to early 20th century. Despite class limitations, Francis uses his golf skills to follow in the footsteps of his idol, British gold champion Harry Vardon, and compete in the 1913 US Open. The film is not just about golf, but also about breaking class barriers and following one's dreams. The cast, costumes, and sets are excellent, and the film is directed with heart and attention to detail by Bill Paxton.",1
"The movie has an interesting concept but suffers from poor execution in both the script and direction. The protagonist, Miles, undergoes a life restoration surgery but lacks a soul, which explains his erratic behavior and indirect responsibility for two deaths. Despite some enjoyable elements, such as Miles' love for brandy and his cousin, the movie's producer and scriptwriter, J.D. Feigelson, failed to bring the idea to life. The score is minimal, and the movie deserves its late-night TV time slot. While the movie is a good example of how to ruin a career in acting or scriptwriting, it is not recommended.",0
"Despite liking S Segal, the movie is disappointing with an unbelievable plot and actions below Segal's standards. The only good part is Segal's performance. The reviewer believes they could write a better script for Segal and the only realistic part is the bad guy getting away. The spoiler reveals laughable scenes such as disecting a black-box recorder in a hotel room and a gas leak.",0
"Despite initial skepticism, this alien abduction movie is worth watching as it effectively suspends disbelief. The main character being a doctor adds credibility to his belief in alien abduction, and Vosloo's sensitive portrayal of his confusion and pain is engaging. While the special effects are sparingly used, they are shocking. However, the plot wanders at times and the ending is disappointing. The supporting characters are weak or menacing, detracting from the overall experience. The movie raises interesting issues, including the concept of ""lost time"" and animal experimentation.",1
"Combining drama and comedy is difficult, but LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE Muslim WORLD succeeded with a great script and Albert Brooks' performance. However, MAN OF THE YEAR fails with a messy message, forced jokes, and an unbelievable love story. The premise of a Jon Stewart-like comedian running for president is promising, but the execution is awkward. The film's message about special interests owning presidential candidates is interesting, but the movie doesn't effectively convey it as a comedy.",0
"This classic movie serial remains captivating despite its dated appearance. The second installment is visually superior but lacks the charm of the original. Middleton and Lipson deliver standout performances, and the Universal editing team excels. The musical score, compiled from various Universal films, adds to the excitement. This serial could be considered the top choice for all-time best.",1
"Shameless Screen Entertainment is a new British DVD-label that specializes in smutty and violent cult movies, mostly Italian ones from the late 60's to mid-80's. They have released rare Italian films like ""Ratman"", ""My Dear Killer"", ""Killer Nun"", ""Phantom of Death"" and ""Torso"". ""The Frightened Woman"" is a weird film that is not suitable for most audiences, but if you appreciate moody and sexy ambiances, bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches, it is a top recommendation. The story revolves around a rich doctor who kidnaps and sexually abuses women, but falls for a journalist he abducts.",1
"The film is a powerful critique of war in general, not just the specific war during which it was made. It follows a married couple, former orchestra musicians, living on an island who are forced to confront the realities of war when it comes to their doorstep. The film does not take sides and instead focuses on the impact of war on ordinary people. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow give excellent performances as a couple whose marriage is tested by the violence and chaos of war. The film is a poignant and emotional exploration of the human cost of war and the toll it takes on individuals and relationships.",1
"Liev's directorial debut ""Everything Is Illuminated"" impressed me with its successful adaptation of the book's nonsensical vocabulary and dreamlike sequences. Despite missing some story elements, the movie's soundtrack, performances, and cinematography all work well. However, the lack of promotion for the film is disappointing, and I only found out about it through a trailer on another DVD. Nonetheless, I highly recommend watching it for a great experience. I give it an 8 out of 10.",1
"After watching the latest episode in the UK, I believe it's difficult to maintain the show's quality. ""Blink"" had Gothic horror elements involving deceptive statues, with minimal appearances from the Doctor and Martha. Despite this, it was well-crafted and part of a high standard set by the last three episodes, including ""The Family"" two-parter. The entire cast, not just David Tennant, contributes to the show's success. Those waiting for series 3 overseas will find it worth the wait.",1
"The film delves into the experience of being accused of subversion through two characters, one being the accused and the other the interrogator. It is a scary journey and may not be understood by those unfamiliar with political systems, as evidenced by most reviews.",1
"The book is great, but the movie with Kylie Minogue was disappointing and lacked passion. Kylie was not a good fit for the feisty Lola character and there was no chemistry between her and Charlie Schlatter. The movie was boring and focused too much on Kylie.",0
"Stefan, a German freshman, hitchhikes to Paris and falls for a mysterious woman in the freak scene. He follows her to Ibiza where they meet Wolf, who owns bars and hotels and keeps Estelle under his control with drugs. Stefan becomes addicted and jealous of Estelle, who is a free spirit. The film has great photography and music, but is cold and dramatic. It emphasizes drug use but is not an exploitation film and has a strong moral message.",1
"The writer watched a movie on TCM and was surprised by how engaging it was. The film features Bogart as a cynical editor who reluctantly goes along with his greedy boss to boost ratings by airing a tell-all radio series about a woman who was acquitted of killing her husband. The movie also provides insight into workplace gender dynamics in the mid-1930s. The supporting cast is unfamiliar to the writer, but they were all excellent, and the direction was taut. The writer recommends the movie to fans of similar films like A Face In The Crowd and An Inspector Calls.",1
"This early sci-fi movie is only worth watching for its campy elements. The dialogue is filled with ridiculous scientific jargon and the female character is only there to be objectified. However, the musical score is well-done and the special effects are decent for the time period. The acting is passable, but the lines given to the actors are so absurd that it's a wonder they didn't burst out laughing.",0
"Despite not being a fan of British drama, I was deeply moved by the characters and their poor decisions in this film's London premiere. The attention to detail and acting were impressive, and while Keira Knightley radiated beauty and innocence, Sienna Miller's performance was Oscar-worthy. However, I agree with others who question why women were attracted to such a despicable character, and I had hoped for his demise. This production is likely to receive other award nominations.",1
"The mini-series ""North and South"" aired from 1985 to 1987 and was based on John Jake's novels. It follows the story of Orry Main, a plantation-born man from South Carolina, and George Hazard, a Yankee from the North, who become friends despite the turbulent era leading to the Civil War. The series covers major Civil War scenes and features cameos from veteran Hollywood actors. While it is historical fiction, it provides entertainment with cliffhanger endings, beautiful cinematography, costumes, and locations. The acting may not be the best, but some performances are noteworthy. Fans of Civil War movies and the Jakes novels should watch this.",1
"A family of farmers moves to Walnut Grove, where Charles works at the mill and the town is run by the wealthy but foolish Olsons. The preacher is disliked and the doctor is old but provides free breast exams. Charles' wife and three daughters also live in town, including Mary who is attractive and Half-Pint who can spit far. The town is small and dangerous, but has a church/school-house/town hall/pool room. Nellie is also attractive and fun to spy on while bathing in the creek.",0
"The success of the movie Closet Land is attributed to the exceptional acting of Stowe and Rickman, despite the challenge of filming in one room with only two characters. It may not appeal to those who prefer action-packed films, but those who appreciate good storytelling should watch it.",1
This thriller is a poor imitation of 'Deliverance' lacking charm and intelligence. The plot is absurd and the cast appears disinterested. It exemplifies a terrible plot and a terrible idea. It's unfortunate to see talented actors like Thomerson and James in such a mess.,0
"The French have improved their Asterix movies with better special effects in Mission Cleopatra, which is the best Asterix story ever written. The movie is entertaining, but deviates from the original comic in some parts. The music choice is too childish, but overall it is a must-see.",1
"The movie is a pleasant surprise with impressive animation in the opening credits. Despite its low budget, the characters are well-developed, and the horror scenes are intense with great makeup effects. The film has a tongue-in-cheek humor that is typical of 80s horror movies. It is recommended for horror fans and can be paired with the 1999 remake of ""House on the Haunted Hill"" due to similarities in set-up and character dynamics.",1
"The DVD was purchased for Julia Ormond's performance, which was impressive, but Bill Paxton's acting was lackluster. Julia's proficiency in French was evident in the film 'Sabrina', but she was chosen for a Dutch film about Belgium in World War 2 over a native French speaker. The film had an odd nature and was out of season. The plot was a mess and unrealistic, with many historical inaccuracies. The film could have been improved with a better script.",0
"Despite the abundance of stupid comedies from various eras that have received DVD treatment, this film, which features talented individuals such as Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal, and Dustin Hoffman in his debut, has been unfairly neglected and was not even released on VHS. It reflects the tastes and customs of the sixties, but has many memorable bizarre, goofy, and wacky moments that create its own absurd universe. It deserves a DVD release and gets the author's vote.",1
"In this episode, Captain Picard, Commander Riker, and Lieutenant Tasha Yar wear formal dress uniforms while dealing with two groups of alien delegates who hate each other and try to capture and eat each other. Riker and Tasha must contain them while a mysterious spacial anomaly injures and kills crew members, ultimately possessing a valuable member of the crew. Irish actor Colm Meaney makes his second appearance on TNG as one of Tasha's security guards.",1
"Leland P. Fitzgerald stabs his ex-girlfriend's mentally disabled brother and no one knows why. In detention, he meets Pearl Madison who wants to understand his motivation. The film jumps between past and present, showing how Leland's crime affects those around him. Ryan Gosling gives a standout performance as Leland. The characters are flawed and there are no heroes in this complex movie.",1
"Bond films are evaluated based on how well they meet expectations, and there are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film. NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not part of the official Bond filmography, but Sean Connery's return as 007 makes it more than an honorary member. The film rates 78 out of 100 on the Bond-o-meter, with strong performances from Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera, and damsel-in-distress Basinger, but lacking in areas such as the opening credits and theme song.",1
"A Brief History of Time is a documentary that tells the story of Stephen Hawking, reflecting the history of the universe. The editing style includes quick fades to black, giving the impression of Hawking's viewpoint. Despite its short running time, the subject matter is vast and fascinating.",1
"The production value is average, with attractive actors and a traditional filming style. However, the premise is frustrating and portrays women negatively. The film also perpetuates negative stereotypes about Eastern Europeans. Overall, it is a tasteless and degrading movie.",0
"The storyline is wordy and lacks character development, and it reinforces negative black stereotypes, leading the reader to question if Jesse Helms was involved in writing the screenplay.",0
"""Hick Trek - The Moovie"" is a 60-minute comedy film that parodies the Star Trek genre by featuring a group of rednecks trying to stop a group of cats from destroying the Redneck Federation. The film is full of humorous moments and has become a cult classic among party-goers.",1
"Having read all of Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them, I believe the 1980's version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour was superior to this one. The new adaptation is less light-hearted and lacks depth, with excessive focus on violence. While the acting is decent, the script is lacking. The costumes are a highlight.",0
"The first twenty minutes of the film evoke powerful emotions through the portrayal of realistic characters and music performances. The film delves deeper into exploring the repressed sexuality of a piano teacher and the cycle of abuse. The graphic scenes of sex and brutality are essential to the film's themes, but may not be suitable for all viewers. The film is great, but not mainstream.",1
"This movie is hilariously bad with terrible acting, dialogue, and plot. It has multiple titles to protect those involved. Despite being rented for Heather Graham, the movie is not scary and is a waste of money. The few no-name actors provide some unintentional comedy, but overall it is not worth watching. Heather Graham's dramatic climax is pathetic and disturbing. The movie is terrible and receives no points.",0
"The movie is about unstable young people in a car and starts off okay but gets weirder. Rachel Leigh Cook's performance is good, but the movie is only recommended for her fans.",0
"The movie is terrible and trying to base it on the first one is a joke. The use of one-liners from the original, delivered by classic actors like Sam Elliot, was a letdown. The new characters' attempts to use these lines fell flat. The movie should have been called a ""Roadhouse wannabe.""",0
"The second Lone Ranger movie is not as good as the 1956 classic, but still has plenty of action and a fast pace. The Ranger investigates a series of murders targeting peaceful Indians, with racial insensitivity present in the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises to solve the case and bring the outlaws to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels star in a colorful presentation set in old Tucson. The music score is good, but lacks the traditional William Tell Overture theme.",1
"I enjoy the character of Jack Frost in the movie sequel, and appreciate the change in setting to a tropical resort. The actor who plays Jack Frost does a great job as a villain and the CGI is good. However, I have a complaint about the appearance of the Jacklings. Overall, the movie is worth watching and I give it 9 stars. If you liked the first movie, you will enjoy this one.",1
"As a Doctor Who fan, I was disappointed with the new series. It may be enjoyable for children under 15 or new fans, but those familiar with the original series will find it lacking. Only die-hard fans or those unfamiliar with the original series should watch it.",0
"The movie had elements of Gary Larson's humor and illustration style, borrowed from Aardman and Pixar, featured Lion King-like villains in an elephant graveyard in farm country, and included an outdated Riverdance joke. The kids enjoyed it, but the dad found it lacking in character design, rendering, script, and direction. It was another unsuccessful attempt by Nickelodeon Films to capitalize on the animation trend.",0
"Sam Elliot delivers a great performance as Detective Charlie Fallon, who, after his partner's death, kills their informant and disposes of the body. Despite being assigned a new partner and tasked with investigating the murder, Fallon struggles with guilt and grief over his actions and his partner's possible involvement in police corruption.",1
"The writer planned to see the movie but couldn't, then saw it with a friend and enjoyed it. The movie is about a heist in Italy, with a group of guys stealing gold bricks. One member turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills the leader. A year later, the leader's daughter helps the group get revenge. The movie has action and humor, with an ongoing joke about a character creating Napster. The only negative is Edward Norton's weak acting. The writer recommends the movie and gives it four out of five stars.",1
"The film introduced me to Chris Cooper's talent and his character as a Union Captain impressed me. The accurate portrayal of Eastern Kentucky's divided sentiments during the Civil War is explored in this drama, which delves into the psychology of people at war. It is the best study of how divided loyalties affected the interaction of peoples in the border states.",1
"The movie was confusing and jumped around, leaving the viewer unsure of what was happening. Despite enjoying the actors and scenery, the ending was also unclear. The viewer would like to read the book to understand what was missed, but does not believe the movie will receive any awards.",0
"This review may contain spoilers for those unfamiliar with the book or movie. The acting between the leads is excellent, but the production values are not top-notch. The film simplifies some relationships and adds unrealistic tension for plot purposes, which is handled better in the book. The end of the book is more touching than the end of the movie.",1
"Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever, despite Plan 9 From Outer Space. Coleman Francis is worse, as evidenced by Glen or Glenda. The first half of the movie explores crossdressing thoughtfully, but the acting is wooden and the middle dream sequence is bizarre. However, the movie is still watchable without assistance from robots.",0
"Alice encounters a world of wonder with characters like the Mad Hatter and the Queen who show her things about her body and others' bodies. Kristine DeBell plays Alice and is considered the most attractive adult actress of her time. The songs in the movie are cheesy but fit the theme, and the trial at the end is well-scripted. This film has a plot and music, which may be overwhelming for those used to adult films with only a short lead-in to sex. It is a special film that could become a cult classic.",1
"This movie, directed by Kevin Tenney, is a unique blend of Pin and Child's Play. While not as good as those films, it still has good actors and a scary Pinocchio puppet. The plot is predictable but the child actress is impressive and there is a memorable shower scene. Overall, it's a decent B-movie.",1
"Uncle Frank and Matthew Ginsburg's film educates and entertains viewers about the struggles of elderly Americans, making it a must-see from a promising filmmaker.",1
"Although lacking in extravagant action scenes, this film boasts exceptional acting and a remarkable script, making it a must-see indie film. The performances of Taylor Nichols and James Remar are particularly noteworthy, and the young cast delivers consistent acting without any weak links. Overall, an impressive film worth watching.",1
"This film is good but different from Seagal's usual movies, which may disappoint some fans. It's not solely focused on Seagal's character and his actions are unique. The concept of him being an intellectual is refreshing. Although there are unrealistic parts, the film is enjoyable. If you're looking for a classic Seagal action film, you may be disappointed, but it's still worth watching. It's some of his best work in a while.",1
"This film is unique and not comparable to ""Mad Max"". It takes place in post-apocalyptic Paris and follows a man's fight for survival in a world where he cannot speak and women are scarce. Luc Besson is praised for the film.",1
"This TV series deserves a 10+ rating due to excellent writing and talented actors, particularly Ms. Toussaint and Ms. Potts who had a genuine relationship on and off camera. The show teaches valuable lessons about historical struggles, relationships, and everyday situations, making it a wonderful family show. The reviewer has taped most episodes and watches them repeatedly.",1
"Although not a movie expert, I found this film to be well-acted and powerful, albeit lacking subtlety. It effectively recreated the feeling of watching a stage play, which added to its eerie atmosphere. The absence of spatial landmarks made it relatable to any political situation. Overall, it was a powerful experience that should be appreciated.",1
"The film did not evoke an emotional response from the author due to poor scripting and lack of character development. A remake with better writers could greatly improve it, as seen in the success of Brokeback Mountain. However, the film's daring subject matter saves it from receiving a 1-star rating.",0
"The film I saw in Madrid had an impressive performance by Gallo, but was otherwise dull and poorly made. Kilmer's role was minimal and his top billing was insulting. The director's other films were also below average, but worth watching for Gallo fans. Others should avoid it.",0
"The film has a great cast including Sutherland, Lane, and Chris Evans, and it's unclear why it hasn't been released yet. The story is based on the author's experiences growing up as the ""poor kid"" in a wealthy community where class affects every aspect of life. During a Q&A, the author revealed that the ultra-rich are not stupid, but rather a threat with plans. The film is timely.",1
"Despite being a terrible film with a low budget, it has a few creepy scenes and unintentionally funny moments. It falls into the ""so bad it's entertaining"" category and is worth watching for that reason alone. The effects and acting are bad, but it has a nostalgic charm. The Alpha DVD print adds to the overall experience.",0
"I watched the film alone and skipped most of it due to the bad script and acting. The photography and directing were partially good, but not enough to save the film. The love scenes were dull and the characters were unlikable. If you like Survivor, you may enjoy this movie, otherwise avoid it.",0
"I enjoyed this movie when it played frequently on Disney Channel, but my taste may have changed since then. It was a 7/10 with good music. Fans are curious about a song played during a car crash scene, ""Play a Love Song"" by the Jaguars, which is difficult to find. The movie is also hard to find online or on physical media. I would like to watch it again to see if it still holds up.",1
"The opening scene featuring Traci Lords in a techno bar is amazing and the best vampire movie with great fight scenes. Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff give impressive performances. It's a great movie with a 9/10 rating, but the sequel Blade II is missing.",1
"The Oscar-winning short film, based on a William Faulkner short story, follows two brothers in small-town Tennessee in December 1941. After the older brother enlists in the military, the younger brother follows suit, showing his determination and devotion. The film highlights the importance of family ties and delivers a cathartic ending. It is a good, clear film that quenches your thirst, but not as expensive or pure as others. It gets the job done and leaves you refreshed. 7/10.",1
"Christian Duguay directed a thrilling espionage movie where naval officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to impersonate Carlos the Jackal. The movie has some violent and sexual scenes that were unfortunately trimmed for TV. Quinn's superiors, played by Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, train and indoctrinate him in the first half of the movie, while the second half has him out in the field making love to the Jackal's woman and shooting it out with enemies. The plan is to make the Jackal look like a turncoat to the Russians, but things don't go as planned. The movie is a fun flick that deserves attention, with the Jackal's former mistress teaching Quinn to rough her up, lick blood from her face, and then go down on her being a standout scene.",1
"This movie highlights Drew Barrymore's acting skills as she portrays an unattractive high school student, a role that is unexpected for her. Despite not typically enjoying uplifting films, the movie provided plenty of humor and was thoroughly enjoyed.",1
"Rae, a high school nymphomaniac, hooks up with Ronnie before he leaves for National Guard duty. After being beaten and left for dead by a friend, she is rescued by Lazarus, who chains her up to keep her from seeking out men. The film explores themes of race, religion, music, and sex.",1
"'Mulholland Drive' is David Lynch's most successful expression of his unique style and vision, blending film noir, horror, surrealism, and parapsychology with postmodern self-consciousness and black humor. The film features wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, whose lives intersect in a hallucinated Hollywood setting. The plot is difficult to explain and involves the discovery of a blue box and key that lead to a complete inversion of what the audience thought they knew. The film is a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip with stunning cinematography, evocative atmospherics, superb acting, and masterful directing/editing.",1
"The final film in the Aztec Mummy trilogy features Dr. Krupp, a mad scientist who wants to find the Aztec treasure buried in modern Mexico City. He creates a robot to defeat the Mummy, but the Mummy easily defeats both the robot and Dr. Krupp. The film is mostly made up of stock footage from previous films and the major star, Ramon Gay, was killed before filming.",0
"Anthony Wong stars in an excellent film that lives up to its title, featuring eroticism and increasing violence due to dreams purchased from a crazed occultist. The sorcerer manipulates Mr. Wong, leading to nightmares of great magnitude. The film is well-filmed, fast-paced, and includes serious magic, herbal medicines, power, corruption, sex scenes, and bloody violence. There are also occasional touches of humor, making for an exhilarating 90 minutes. The performances are excellent.",1
"Fans of Twin Peaks and HP Lovecraft will appreciate this film's eerie and familiar horror. It's not a traditional Western horror, but more like a Grimm's fairy tale. It's gory and for mature audiences, but captivating and memorable.",1
"I saw a pre-screening of this movie through UCLA and it was incredibly good. It made me laugh and I talked about it a lot afterwards. I now have a strong admiration for Tenacious D and will buy their album. It's worth the expensive ticket price for the comedy and amazing music. The storyline ties in well with the traditional ""D"" history and there are great cameos. It's one of the best movies, so go see it.",1
"Despite its visual beauty and good music, this film has a predictable and clichéd made-for-TV feel. The romance between the two main characters, who come from different backgrounds, is not believable. The movie follows a predictable plot, which is disappointing given its potential. It may be worth watching for free on cable, but it is not worth paying for. The soundtrack is the only redeeming quality.",0
"Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen, drawing inspiration from Rock Hudson's real-life dilemma of being a secretly homosexual screen idol. The film's retro production design is amusingly reminiscent of a Shag greeting card, but the dialogue is not very clever and the slapstick humor falls flat. However, the serious tone of the final act is handled with great taste and the pro-gay speech is a plea for tolerance. The movie lacks a clear agenda and the sentimental ending may come across as a prank to invested audiences.",0
"As a child 30 years ago, I watched a film that has stayed with me. I cannot judge its quality, but I was enamored with Jean Simmons and the erotic tone of the movie. I recall the plot and also had a similar experience with Simmons in David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS. Unfortunately, BLUE LAGOON is not on video, and I wish to revisit it to clarify my memories.",1
"The second Jackass movie is almost as good as the first, but with more disgusting skits. Fans of the first movie will enjoy it, but those who didn't like it will hate this one. Some scenes are classic, while others are disturbing. Despite mixed reviews, it's worth watching.",1
"This movie is one of my best possessions, and it took me years to acquire. It was intended to be anti-drug propaganda but ends up glorifying drug use. However, the consequences of drug use are eventually shown, delivering the intended anti-drug message. The soundtrack, featuring Pink Floyd, is excellent. It is a must-see movie.",1
"The animation and color in the film are great, with exaggerated teeth and mouths that make you laugh. The clever comedy throughout the film requires multiple viewings to catch all the gags. The film pokes fun at people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens. The only complaints are the portrayal of the cleric as an idiot and the overdone final action scene. Overall, it's an amusing film that will provide many laughs and can be enjoyed multiple times.",1
The movie that I enjoyed as a child is no longer entertaining to me as an adult. The jokes are now too childish and the plot is not believable. The villain is poorly portrayed and the final fight scenes are disappointing. I give it a 4 out of 10 rating.,0
"As a fan of this comedy, I have been waiting for its DVD release and got tired of waiting for it. I transferred my VHS copy to DVD and the quality is surprisingly good. I am offering to do the same for anyone interested for £7.00, which only covers my costs and postage. I am not looking to profit from it, just want to share this overlooked gem of a comedy. Payment details can be discussed through email.",1
"This movie is the worst I've ever seen. It misrepresents the Fantastic Four and should only be sold in comic book stores for desperate geeks. The cast's futures have been negatively impacted, except for Jay Underwood's performance. However, he is unlikely to get major roles unless he has a rare and interesting career spark.",0
"Although not personally entertained by Mr. Boorman's movies, the author finds Where the Heart Is to be a masterful satire and social commentary of its time. The author has had to replace their copy of the movie multiple times due to lending it out to others who appreciate its artistry. The author's favorite aspect of the movie is the paintings by Timna Woollard, which they have been searching for 15 years to acquire. They are looking for any information on where to find Timna's work or her studio in England.",1
"This is the uncut musical Alice, with a large cast enjoying themselves. Although there are a few off moments, it is amusing, tuneful, and just sexy enough. Kristine DeBell gives a fine performance in the lead role. There may even be an uncredited appearance by Richard Prior as the prone Knight.",1
"Chokher Bali is a film adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore's novel about a rebellious widow named Binodini who is denied marriage by two handsome men. She manipulates her way into the household of one of the men and fulfills her sexual desires, leading to a dramatic climax. The film explores themes of individual freedom and widow marriage, which was taboo at the time the story was written. The art direction and cinematography are praised for bringing early 20th century Bengal to life.",1
"I watched a snowboarding film before my holiday to get in the mood. The snowboarding scenes were impressive, but the story and comedy were poorly written and lacked depth. It may be worth watching for the snowboarding, but there are better films dedicated to the sport.",0
"Soul's Midnight is a fun and entertaining low budget vampire movie that incorporates St. George and the Dragon mythology in a unique way. Starring Armand Assante as the vampire leader, the movie could have benefited from a higher budget for better gore and effects. It's a good choice for fans of Gothic horror and vampire lore.",1
"The writer attended the Berlinale competition and saw a movie billed as a ""world premiere,"" but had difficulty getting into the film due to limited knowledge of the plot. The movie had a strange mix of light, dark, and supernatural elements, and the cuts and storytelling were abrupt and disruptive. The actors were good, but could not save the movie. The writer watched the movie with a technical eye and felt that it failed to draw them in. They expected more from a movie with such talented actors.",0
"The movie is depressing and asks more questions than it can answer, unlike the uplifting themes in the creator's previous works. The ending is not ""tacked on"" and follows logically from the premise, but there are flaws in the execution. The lead actor is excellent and the depiction of the Messiah's humanity and the modern world's reaction to the second coming are well done. The reviewer personally found the movie too bleak and prefers entertainment that is uplifting or distracting.",0
