"I rented a movie because the box looked cool with a guy's face axed in half. It turned out to be a masterpiece with many references to ""Evil Dead"" and other movies. The plot, characters, effects, and humor were all good, but it was slow before the main character went insane. I gave it a 9 and recommend it to fans of ""Evil Dead 2"" and similar movies.",1
"The film was inspired by the fact that American gangsters dress well, while Australian ones can dress poorly without criticism due to their violent tendencies. The story follows Jimmy, an illegal boxer and bouncer who works for local gangster boss Pando in Australia's Kings Cross District. After messing up a job due to love, Jimmy must repay Pando before he is killed. The film explores the nature of Australian criminals and has dark humor and interesting action, but lacks depth in some areas. It is recommended to watch with ""Chopper"" and ""Dirty Deeds"" for an Aussie crime fest or ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Miller's Crossing"" for an international criminal gang theme. Bryan Brown is a great actor who has done many bad movies, but this is one of his great ones.",1
"The movie is not impressive, with a cast resembling a Saved by the Bell reunion and a poorly designed monster. The military is portrayed as useless, with even highly trained individuals like navy seals and marines dying easily. The plot involves a crazy cryptozoologist trapping a Chupacabra and smuggling it onto a cruise ship, where it is released by two crew members. The only noteworthy part is when the captain's daughter defeats the monster with martial arts, despite the fact that it had previously wiped out an entire navy seals unit.",0
"This movie is a typical New York comedy that relies on the city's craziness to make up for a lack of talent. The characters have no clear motives and the plot is just a series of poorly written scenes. While there are some amusing moments, overall the movie is a disappointment. If you want to watch a good light-hearted crime movie, try ""Brother"" instead. The director should focus on exciting, amusing, enlightening, or entertaining the audience instead of being boring.",0
"Steve Railsback's lead roles are typically good, but Lifeforce is an exception. The confusing horror/sci-fi film improves towards the end when London becomes Zombie City, but overall it is difficult to watch. The naked spacegirl/vampire is the only redeeming quality. It deserves a 4 out of 10 rating.",0
"Red Sonja, played by Brigitte Nielsen, is a female version of Conan and the film feels cheap. Arnold Schwarzenegger appears in the film but not as Conan and only appears every twenty minutes. The film is slow and boring, so watch Conan the Barbarian instead.",0
"Gregory Peck and Gig Young compete for the same woman. Peck sends Young on a dangerous mission and is blamed. Feeling guilty, Peck defends a fort with a group of soldiers he considers to be the worst. The script is based on a novel by Charles Marquis Warren, a western specialist. The film inspired later movies, including ""The Dirty Dozen.""",1
"Visitors is a slow and unenjoyable movie, despite its short length. The action scenes are good, but the slow pacing and lack of clear explanation for the hauntings make it hard to recommend. The creepy setting and effective use of atmosphere are not enough to make up for the overall boredom and derivative nature of the film.",0
"Ramón brings his college friends to an abandoned school building to investigate a diary from his dying father. They relive a horrifying episode from 20 years ago where a sadistic security guard kills five of six people. As they try to escape, the killer hunts and destroys them in various bloody ways. The film has professional gloss, shocking violence, and witty dialogue with pop-culture references. The use of cues and flashbacks may annoy some viewers, but the plot moves quickly, and the camera follows the characters' reactions to the chaotic situation. The paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot may affect your enjoyment of the film. The twist is abrupt, but it works with the story. As a slasher flick, it's a breath of fresh air.",1
"Six of a Kind features W.C. Fields in a memorable 10-minute scene, including his famous pool sequence from vaudeville. The remaining 55 minutes are enjoyable, largely due to Charlie Ruggles' hilarious performance as the bumbling banker J. Pinkham Whinney, with Mary Boland and George Burns and Gracie Allen also providing comedic moments. While Gracie can become tiresome, the overall situation is consistently funny as the Whinneys and their companions embark on a road trip to California. The film receives an 8/10 rating.",1
"A documentary explores the 1993 siege of a religious compound in Waco, Texas, where 76 people, including the sect leader, died in a fire. The cause of the fire is still disputed, raising questions about government ethics.",1
"In 2055, the wealthy can travel back in time to hunt live dinosaurs for a high price through Time Safari, a business that uses Sonia Rand's time machine. Dr. Travis Ryer leads a team to kill a dinosaur, but a hunter accidentally steps on and kills a butterfly, causing major changes to the earth's climate and evolution. Travis and Sonia attempt to stop the changes before they become permanent and lead to human extinction. The movie received a 4/10 rating and was criticized for its slow pace and unrealistic concept of a single butterfly causing significant changes.",0
Michael Jackson's music video featuring Vincent Price's rap and zombies dancing with him is one of his best. He is a favorite singer and one of the best in the world.,1
"Since 1996, I have been continuously satisfied by this movie and novel. Even after ten years, I still remember every dialogue. It is perfect, and I particularly love Willem Defoe's unique voice and the spiritual music by Szararem. No one can replicate this masterpiece. Thank you to Ondaatje and Mingela.",1
"The marketing for 'The New Twenty' features a half-naked male on the poster/home video cover, making it a must-see for fans of gay-themed movies. Despite the stereotyped gay characters, the film focuses on long-term friendship and characters growing apart, with more heterosexual couples having sex outside of marriage. The film feels more suited for TV than the big screen, lacking originality and dealing with familiar themes such as AIDS and drug addiction. The most interesting character is the heavier-set one, Ben.",0
"A 6-part miniseries intertwines four stories about the drug trade in Europe. A German businessman's wife continues his illegal trade after he is arrested, while the British Home Secretary's daughter becomes addicted to heroin during his trip to Pakistan to negotiate an aid package. The original miniseries is superior to its American adaptations, portraying the poverty and desperation of the third world in a stark, uncompromising, and brutal manner.",1
"By mistake, I watched a serious movie on Lifetime about a young woman being attacked by a fellow student who thinks he's above the system. The cast was believable and the performances credible, making it better than the average film of this type. However, the movie seemed slow and repetitive, and the climax could have been given more detail and length.",1
"I watched a bad movie that used the tired trope of a martial arts teacher turned actor fighting his way through a boring plot. The only reason I watched it was because the lead actress was pretty. The movie has many mistakes, which can be fun to find or bothersome for perfectionists. Hopefully, these types of movies will stop being made, but then where will low budget actors go?",0
"Advent Children may please fans of the original game with its familiar settings, characters, music, and action scenes, but it falls short as a standalone movie due to sloppy direction during fight scenes, lack of character development, and a weak plot. The CG is impressive, but not as detailed as in Spirits Within. The film serves more as a side story than a true sequel and is a brainless action flick. The author is not bothered by negative feedback from fans.",0
"The show should have continued with new storylines after season 2. It presents both normal and extremist views of Islam and tackles controversial topics in a meaningful way. The show is well-cast and believable, and it is unfortunate that the writer did not discover it until 2007.",1
"Eisenstein's 1938 film ""Nevsky"" retells the battle of the ice of 1242, with the Germanic knights representing the Nazis. The film is a piece of propaganda and marks Eisenstein's return to official favor after a decade of being out of favor with Stalin. The film's strong points are the battle scenes and Prokofiev's soundtrack, but the comic relief is jarring.",1
"Lestat wakes up after a 100-year sleep to new music and forms a band, angering other vampires and awakening an ancient evil. The film is not a faithful adaptation of the book, but is satisfying overall with good casting and sexy relationships. The story is compelling and draws the viewer in, with simmering sensuality and sexual tension.",1
"'Beep Beep' is the second popular Road Runner cartoon by Chuck Jones, which improves on its predecessor with longer and more ambitious sequences, including a chase through an old mine and a funny gag with rocket-powered roller-skates. The representation of Wile E. Coyote is also improved, with better looks to the camera. Although slow to start, 'Beep Beep' confirms the potential for a series to be made from these characters.",1
"Despite some predictability, House of Wax is one of the best horror/suspense films from Hollywood in years, delivering chills, thrills, and gore. While some parts are far-fetched and the acting is not great, the movie is still rated an eight out of ten. It's perfect for those who enjoy being on the edge of their seats and offers a unique perspective on wax museums.",1
"Despite the implausible plot, the film is worth watching for the outstanding performances of Caine and Gambon, with the latter delivering an impressive Dublin accent. Caine's exaggerated acting suits his character well, making the film enjoyable and easy to watch for an hour and a half.",1
"The commenter agrees with some points but disagrees on others. They do not believe the film is similar to ""THE CARS THAT ATE Paris"" and instead see it as a weird Euro work with some surreal elements. They praise the music by Heuzenroeder for its use of whistling and consider it better than most Australian films. They express confusion over the film's title and make a reference to David Bowie.",1
"The movie ""Secretos"" has a predictable plot based on a novel, but is carried by strong dramatic performances from Jordana Brewster, Christopher Eccleston, and Blythe Danner. The story follows Jordana's character and her sister's ex-boyfriend as they travel to Europe to uncover the truth behind her sister's death. The film includes minimal nudity and the sex scenes are not intended to be steamy. Overall, it is a great choice for those who enjoy solid dramatic features. The ending is particularly moving, with flashbacks of the two little sisters.",1
"I enjoyed this movie, which has a straightforward plot and is reportedly based on a true story. Despite my affinity for 80's hard rock/hair metal, the film is enjoyable even without the music. It's worth watching unless you're an extremely critical viewer who only appreciates movies of ""Citizen Kane"" quality.",1
"The sequel to the original Robocop film is set in Old Detroit, where the Omni Consumer Corporation is constructing a new city and a drug lord named Cain is causing trouble. Robocop tries to stop him but gets destroyed, leading to the creation of a new android. The film tries to capture the magic of the first one but falls short, with excessive violence and a mean-spirited tone. Overall, it leaves the viewer feeling apathetic and wondering why they aren't watching the original instead.",0
"I expected a low-budget American movie with bad actors, but was pleasantly surprised by the natural performance of the lead actor in the film about a student who creates a fake school. Despite opposition, the school becomes popular and offers a unique learning experience. The film has flaws but is a cheerful, feel-good movie with unexpected plot twists.",1
"Death Wish 3 is the second best movie in the series, with Death Wish 5 being the best. The movie features a New York neighborhood plagued by a single, violent gang. Deborah Raffin plays a public defender and adds a gentle touch to the action-packed film. The protagonist, Kersee, uses a new gun called the Wildey .475 Magnum, which packs a big punch. Kersee also uses an antitank missile to kill the main gang leader, which is an unusual weapon for a vigilante.",1
"The writer strongly disagrees with the previous comments and believes the film is worse than ""Carry on Columbus."" They feel that the humor has not progressed and that actors like Charles Hartrey and Barbara Windsor were out of place. The writer believes that the series continued with subpar films like ""Carry on Behind"" and ""Carry on England,"" but ""Carry on Dick"" was not bad. However, the writer believes that this film signaled the end of the series, which is a shame because there were no bad films before this one.",0
"The movie about making a movie is pointless and lacks the enjoyable elements of the original, including the fun music. However, the appearance of the Pathmark guy is entertaining.",0
"The movie about the first attack on the World Trade Center is unlikely to be shown on HBO or re-released, but can be found in video stores. It highlights the failure of government agencies to prevent the attack and is chilling because we now know it was not the end of the terrorist threat. The film is difficult to watch after the events of 9/11 and the ending is powerful and prophetic. It is recommended to not watch the movie alone.",1
"The latest Ghibli movie is a departure from their usual style, aimed at young children with a new animation style. Despite lacking depth, it is entertaining and endearing due to the honest plot and characters. The soundtrack is amazing and features a cute theme song.",1
"The movie ""Distant"" is a waste of time, with most scenes consisting of nothing happening and the camera seemingly left on to increase the length of the movie. The actors did a good job, but the story was lacking and there was nothing funny about it. It could have been condensed into a short film.",0
"The author suspects a distorted view of Patrice Lumumba, who is portrayed as a trouble-maker inciting violence. Lumumba's inability to control his people and his decision to seek Soviet help led to US involvement and his assassination. However, replacing him with Mobutu did not improve the situation. The film is well-acted, with great cinematography and music, and is recommended.",1
"Nurse Betty is a refreshing film that stands out from the disappointments of the summer. Director Neil LaBute showcases his ability to direct beyond disturbing sexual themes. Renee Zellweger delivers her best performance as Betty, a waitress who escapes into a fantasy world after witnessing her husband's death. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play hitmen on her trail, and the film cleverly portrays Freeman and Zellweger as parallel characters. Nurse Betty is a brilliant film that balances humor, love, and graphic violence.",1
"I am a big fan of Lynn Peterson since her breakthrough role in ""Far North"" in 1988. Her role as ""Driver"" in this movie is her strongest performance, but unfortunately, the movie doesn't have much else going for it. The editing to remove profanity for TV viewers is creative. I am looking for another Lynn Peterson poster.",0
"Romanian cinema is not well-known outside of Romania, with few directors gaining international attention. Lucian Pintilie is one of the few great directors in Romanian cinema, with his film 'Reconstituirea' being a reference for the industry. 'Furia' is a well-directed film about a lost generation dealing with the emergence of sub-culture and moral filth. It creates an emotional link between the characters and the viewer and could compete on the Western market. There is hope for a new generation of Romanian films to make its place in the international cinema scene. The film receives an 8/10 rating.",1
"""I consider 'Police Squad!' the funniest TV show of the 1980s and have all six episodes on BetaMax. ABC foolishly cancelled it, claiming viewers didn't realize it was a comedy without a laugh track. I've watched each episode at least ten times and always find new gags. If you haven't seen it, don't miss the chance, but you probably already have it if you're reading this.""",1
"The film is rated a 10 because it is compared to both similar films and the low quality of popular culture. It features a well-cast look at popular theater from the late 18th and early 20th centuries, with many of the plays involving a ""Chauncey Olcott Act."" The director, John Ford, also directed ""The Quiet Man,"" which is similar to ""My Wild Irish Rose."" The film has great songs and is enjoyable. The author is interested in learning more about Bill Scanlan, a former star who suffered from insanity and died in an asylum.",1
"I was thrilled to find it on the shelf, but was disappointed when I fell asleep while watching it. I tried again the next day, but still couldn't enjoy it. I'm a fan of the director's other work, but this one didn't work for me. However, I did appreciate the camera work.",0
"The writer had been hesitant to buy the film due to disappointment with the director's previous works and the fact that it had been edited for gore. However, after renting it, they found it to be a good imitation of ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" with an unsettling atmosphere and effective scares. The young cast was not as obnoxious as expected and George Kennedy's character added depth. The family in the woods is revealed to be hiding a dark secret, and the Ranger offers an explanation for their behavior. The film has some violence but not too much.",1
"I enjoyed watching Surface with my family and would like to see it return. The plot and storyline were excellent, but it seems that many shows today lack substance. The show had a large following and it was disappointing to be left hanging about the characters' fates. I also miss other shows like 8 Days and Greatest American Hero, which were cancelled for various reasons.",1
"Thursday is a crime film influenced by the 'new wave' of crime films popularized by Quentin Tarantino in the 90s. It follows the story of Casey, a former drug dealer turned architect, whose life takes a turn when his old partner in crime, Nick, shows up with drugs and stolen money. The film is set in a single location and features quirky characters that make it an amusing thriller. While it doesn't offer anything new cinematically or plot-wise, the film's dark humor and witty dialogue make it an enjoyable watch. The cast, led by Thomas Jane, delivers decent performances, making Thursday a fun movie with a few twists.",1
"Despite being born in 1994, the reviewer's childhood was heavily influenced by the 80s, with a preference for playing NES games like Zelda. The movie holds a special place in their heart due to their exposure to many TV shows and movies that other kids didn't see. The plot involves a race around the world with diamond smugglers tricking the children into delivering their diamonds. The film features great animation, top-notch voice acting, and kick-ass music, with the reviewer's favorite song being ""The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll."" The film has a happy ending, and the reviewer gives it a solid 10 out of 10.",1
"The movie ""Judge and Jury"" is poorly titled and has bad lighting. The killer, played by David Keith, is disguised well, but the movie is overall stupid. It is one of many recent ludicrous productions from Unapix and is a waste of time.",0
"The movie was interesting but had a disjointed plot. Despite this, the two main actors performed well, with Sean Penn stealing the show. He has since proven to be a versatile actor, displaying comedic talent in Sweet and Lowdown, which was unexpected. He is more talented than previously thought.",1
"Critics, some of whom are ordinary people, have praised the film Subconscius Cruelty as beautiful, but the author disagrees. They criticize the poor quality of the filming and the gratuitous depiction of extreme violence and sexual acts. The author warns readers not to waste their time on the film.",0
"The film is terrible, with poor acting and slow pacing, and lacks a clear purpose. The sex scenes are uncomfortable to watch and the overall quality is one of the worst I've seen.",0
"The first two hours of the TV version are mostly exposition, with the action starting in the second half. Some character relationships are only clear later on. The acting is competent, but not exceptional, except for Randy Quaid's annoying character. The plot is a mix of several disaster films, with predictable events and dialogue. The special effects are very poor, worse than those in ""CSI"" or ""Cold Case"". ""The Day After"", ""Asteroid"", or ""Special Bulletin"" are better options for made-for-TV disaster films with better plots, acting, and effects.",0
"SEA OF DUST won Best Picture at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival and features a quality feel with an original classical style musical score. The film follows a young doctor investigating strange events caused by a villain who views suffering as the key to establishing his version of the Kingdom of God on Earth. The movie includes a lot of blood, torture, and gore, as well as comedic moments. The director also explores the theme of religion being misused to back wars and killings. The film features stars like Savini and Pitt, a good supporting cast, and is an excellent independent film effort.",1
"""The Falcon and the Snowman"" is a true story about two disillusioned young men, a CIA employee and a drug dealer, who sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give convincing performances in the lead roles, with David Suchet delivering a notable performance as a Soviet agent. While the film effectively develops its premise, it can feel overlong and cumbersome at times. The ending is tense and effective, but the soundtrack includes some catchy rock songs and a mellow synthesizer track that doesn't fit with the spy story. Overall, ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" is a decent film, but there are better spy films to watch.",1
"As a romantic who enjoys musicals and comedy, this film was perfect. Julie Andrews delivers a captivating performance in the beginning and end, particularly in the ""Whistling in the Dark"" production number. Her hilarious and shocking performance in the middle of the film, when she suspects Rock Hudson of seeing a call girl, is sure to make you laugh. I wish this film was available on video or DVD so I could add it to my personal collection.",1
"The movie ""Finding Neverland"" simplifies and romanticizes the life of J.M. Barrie, leaving out important details such as the presence of Arthur Llewelyn Davies and the tragic deaths of several family members. The author criticizes Hollywood biopics for their formulaic approach and lack of complexity, and suggests that if Hollywood made a movie about anyone's life, it would be similarly oversimplified. Despite its flaws, the movie is likely to receive awards due to the Academy's tendency to reward familiar patterns. The reality of Barrie's life was much sadder than the movie portrays, with multiple deaths and tragedies.",0
"After seeing the trailer, I knew I had to watch ""The United States of Leland"". Although it doesn't have a happy ending, it leaves you with an empty feeling that allows you to reflect on the characters and society. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as Leland and the supporting cast, including Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle, is excellent. It's a smart and thought-provoking film that I highly recommend.",1
"I love Farscape because it offers a fresh take on older sci-fi styles and isn't afraid to have characters die. The show has heartwarming characters that grow on you, and it leaves you feeling a mix of hope and despair with unexpected twists. It's worth watching even if you're short on time.",1
"Initially expecting a romantic comedy, the writer rented ""Broadcast News"" under the comedy genre and was pleasantly surprised by the film's realistic script and talented cast. Despite the lack of a traditional happy ending, the truthful conclusion was appreciated and deemed genius. The film is considered a classic and a great romance movie. A rating of 9/10 was given.",1
"While watching TV, I discovered a captivating movie about the Burmese people's fight against a military dictatorship. The level of brutality used to maintain power was shocking, and it made me grateful to live in a country without such violence. The story of Laura Bowman helped tie the political struggle together.",1
"Franco's films can be categorized into four groups: ""earlies,"" ""naughties,"" ""nudies,"" and ""the rest."" This particular film falls under ""the rest"" category and is not a cannibal or gorefest movie. There is minimal full frontal nudity and the picture quality is poor. As a Franco fan, the reviewer suggests not wasting time on this film and doing something else instead.",0
"Pauly Shore fans will find the movie hilarious, but for others, it's a waste of talented actors. The plot involves a South Dakota coed inviting her California dorm counselor to Thanksgiving. Notable cast members include Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Mason Adams, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen. Be careful while watching.",0
"I knew Brad Linaweaver in college and thought he was a talented writer. However, after watching a video he made, it seems that he has not achieved the success I had hoped for. It is a sad reminder that chasing dreams without a solid foundation or goals can lead to neglect and deterioration.",0
"The adaptation of Gulliver's Travels has two parts: the ""now"" time where Gulliver is put into a mental asylum, and the ""described"" time where he describes his travels. The choppy tempo makes it difficult to suspend disbelief, and the ""now"" time adds nothing to the story. The CGI is well done, but many parts of the real travels are cut out. The first part is rated 0/10, and the actual travel coverage is rated 8/10, averaging out to a 4/10. The adapter may have added filler to keep costs down and produce a mini-series of a set length.",0
"Harold Lloyd, a comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage, incorporated sound gags in his ""silent"" films, but his sound features consistently failed at the box office due to the Great Depression and his perception as an insincere glad hander. His film, The Cat's-Paw, suffered due to its pro-fascist agenda and ill-timed release. The film posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and does so with good nature and fun. However, Lloyd should be credited for not making any further pro-fascist films and never selling The Cat's-Paw to television.",0
"To experience black filmmaking in the 70s, watch this film with funny dialogue, boom mic appearances, and great karate action. Approach it with an open mind and enjoy the world of Dolemite, but don't take it too seriously. Despite rough editing, the film has had a significant impact on the black community.",1
"The SyFy movie is better than most, but still not great. The plot involves a game made from a dead witch's bones and skin, which predicts the death of one of the players. The rest of the movie follows typical horror movie tropes, with a puzzle at the end and a subplot involving a cop who wants to use the game to bring back his family. Overall, it's messy.",0
"After watching ""Final Ascent"" by the same writer, I rented this video and was surprised by its intensity. I was captivated throughout and supported the teenagers in their crime. Although the ending was disturbing, it was well-executed. I strongly suggest watching this film.",1
"The movie has received mixed reviews, with those expecting a war movie giving it a low rating. It is an independent documentary about Gallipoli without bias, and those who appreciate this will find it moving and impressive. It does not have actors, gunfire, or gore.",1
"Despite high expectations from earlier reviews, the slow and basic plot of the story left the reader disappointed. The story follows a boy and girl who meet at a young age, both aspiring to be basketball legends. They grow apart but reunite in college, only to be separated again when the boy's father is caught cheating. The boy becomes a professional basketball player and dumps the girl, but they reunite years later after a basketball shootout. The story ends with the girl playing basketball and the boy taking care of their baby. The story received a low score from the reader and their partner.",0
"The writer enjoyed the book more than the popular Da Vinci Code and bought the DVD of the movie adaptation, but disliked Angels and Demons and will not watch it again. The film deviated significantly from the book, particularly in the events surrounding the discovery of the technology and the characters' relationships. The writer found the changes to be a mistake and the film to be one of the worst they have seen, causing them to lose feeling in their legs. They want a refund and are surprised that Ron Howard will continue to find work.",0
"Despite being a soft-core film with nonsensical dialogue and an extraneous plot, this movie has a hypnotic and pleasant mood due to its beautiful scenery, soft-focus nudity, and wonderful score. It is a rare and enjoyable example of filmmaking that is one of the author's ""guilty pleasures."" They have watched it numerous times on an old laserdisc.",1
"Many fail to grasp the true message of this film, which is about love and truth. It highlights the prevalence of insincere words in today's society, leading to high divorce rates. The film encourages following one's heart and fighting for what one believes in, even if commitment is not always enough. The ending is realistic, emphasizing the importance of not giving up on love.",1
"The Residents' music videos are abnormal and bizarre, but have great artistic value due to their thoughtful visuals and lighting. Icky Flix is a collection of their music videos ranging from rock to synthesized music with 80s horror film vibes. The videos are highly original and visually interesting, making them mini-classics for art film fans. The music is creepy and catchy, making the collection a near-perfect rating of four out of four stars and a runtime of 56 minutes.",1
"""Murder in the Music Hall"" is a forgotten Republic Picture that deserves more attention. The film is a well-produced and directed mystery-suspense set in Radio City Music Hall, with a murder casting suspicion on the Rockettes. William Marshall hunts down the killer in a complex and creepy plot, with a surprise ending. The film is worth restoring and reviving, as it is as enjoyable as any major studio film of its era. Pay attention to the victim's rhapsodic song to discover the killer. It is a loss that movies like this are no longer made.",1
"The film portrays an average family with a father who only cares about his son's swimming success, leaving his other children and wife ignored. A tragic event leads to drug use, partying, and a dark secret revealed by the mother. The film includes a mix of comedy and drama, as well as a homosexual scene.",1
"I enjoyed the movie almost as much as the original. The story of Scamp's desire for independence is relatable to most teenagers. The songs and character designs were good, and Lady and Tramp looked similar to the original. The voice actors did a good job, but I wish there were more lines for some characters. The scenery remained the same as the original film.",1
"Dr Steven Segal stars in a movie where he saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak. The film is unintentionally funny and has become a cult classic. Segal's character tries to portray himself as sensitive, a good father, a man of science, in tune with nature, politically correct, multicultural, an iconoclast, and an action hero. The movie is so bad that it's enjoyable to watch with friends, especially while intoxicated.",0
The writer misses the show Promised Land and wishes it had not been cancelled by CBS. They believe it was a great show for families and would like to see a reunion. They also ask if the show is available on DVD and if the last season was fully aired. The writer fondly remembers the show's opening theme song.,1
"The recently discovered series AN AGE OF KINGS can be viewed in excerpts on http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html, but it is not widely available. Its popularity is hindered by the existence of THE WARS OF THE ROSES, which has a similar cast and is more accessible. Despite their differences in dramaturgy, both series have strong casting.",1
"Ernesto and Manco make a living by deceiving people, but when they team up with the more experienced Federico, they become successful until Federico's former love interest appears. The Spanish film, directed by Miguel Bardem, is light-hearted and enjoyable, with some funny moments. Federico Luppi is a standout actor in the film, while Ernesto Alterio and Victoria Abril also deliver strong performances. Miguel Alexandre is also noteworthy as Manco.",1
"Despite being a novice in mountaineering, the reviewer found the film K2 to be unrealistic and lacking in accuracy. The climbers in the film perform miraculous feats of endurance without proper acclimatization and are barely out of breath. The reviewer suggests that the film may be enjoyable for those with no knowledge of mountaineering, but it is far removed from reality. The scenery is beautiful, but the storyline is clichéd and fantastical. The reviewer suspects that the filmmakers may have ignored expert advice in pursuit of a heroic storyline. Additionally, using the phrase ""welcome to the death zone"" at 200000 feet would be inappropriate.",0
"The standout feature of the movie was Kelly Overton's impressive acting, while the overall plot felt familiar. Despite this, the reviewer recommends the movie, particularly for Overton's performance, and rates it a 7 out of 10.",1
"The movie is impressive, but the script could have been improved with less cliched language. It references Joyce's ""The Dead"" and features stunning scenery and excellent acting, creating a poetic atmosphere. It is highly recommended.",1
The story follows a soldier who is transported to a desert town and recounts how he became separated from his unit while fighting in Egypt. He befriended a leopard and became almost feral before eventually leaving the animal. The film is well-written and features beautiful scenery from Jordan and Utah.,1
"Everyone agrees that the first season was the best, but killing off Boone and other characters was a bad decision made by the directors and writers. Despite this, the series is still the best sci-fi series ever. The quality of the series decreased after the first season, but Liam is an acceptable replacement for Boone. Lilli's exit from the story was undeserved, and Renee's character is lacking. The Taelons remain mysterious, and the conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are brilliant. Watching from the beginning is necessary to fully understand the show, but the acting, special effects, music, and plot are all great. It's a must-see.",1
"Lifeforce is a 1985 film directed by Tobe Hooper and funded by Cannon. It follows the story of two space vampires accidentally brought to Earth during a space shuttle mission. The film showcases the natural beauty of Mathilda May, who plays the title role. The film is well-directed and photographed, with plenty of gore effects for genre fans. Tobe Hooper made three interesting films for Cannon during this time period, including Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars. The film is highly recommended for fans of science fiction/horror films, Tobe Hooper, or Mathilda May.",1
"The film adaptation of Anne Rice's book is set in Australia and features stunning scenery. Lestat betrays his vampire oath and becomes a movie icon, causing his fellow vampires to plot his death. Jesse, an orphaned member of a supernatural studies group, becomes obsessed with Lestat and reads his diary, which reveals encounters with the Queen of the Damned. Akasha, the Queen, goes on a killing spree and tempts Lestat with royalty. The film has great fight scenes, music, and locations, and Aaliyah looked stunning on set. The reviewer gives the film a 10/10 rating and recommends it.",1
"This movie is like Top Gun but without the same level of animosity, class, money, or Tom Cruise. It features a cast of up-and-coming actors trying to prove their ability to lead a successful film, but ultimately falls short. The opening shot with Charlie Sheen shows promise, but is quickly ruined by a ridiculous wedding scene. Dennis Haysbert and Michael Biehn are decent in their roles, but Sheen never quite becomes an action hero. The movie receives a 3/10 rating.",0
"The movie ""Half Past Dead"" takes place in a prison that was once a tourist attraction and is now a mix of an airport and a junior high school. The plot follows an FBI agent who goes undercover in the prison to infiltrate a criminal organization. The movie is filled with poorly choreographed action sequences and ridiculous scenes, such as inmates playing basketball in the middle of a cell block. The only good scene is when Ja Rule's character gets slapped around by a little Asian woman. The movie received a PG-13 rating, which Roger Ebert criticized in comparison to the R rating given to the anti-gun movie ""Bowling for Columbine.""",0
"The writer expresses disappointment in NBC's decision to cancel Las Vegas, a show that had been excellent for five years. They criticize NBC's current programming, which includes uninteresting reality and game shows, and suggest that even Law and Order has become stale. The writer urges NBC to bring back Vegas and compares the network unfavorably to its past. They also suggest that CBS should consider picking up the show.",1
"The writer was initially worried about the Apocalypse film, as it had a lot to live up to after the success of the League of Gentlemen's stage show, radio show, and TV series. However, after seeing the film, the writer was blown away by its brilliance and attention to detail. The film works on many levels and is enjoyable for both casual and obsessive fans. The story moves at a swift pace and includes favorite characters from the show. The film is dark, a little scary, and a little strange, fitting for The League of Gentlemen. The in-jokes may puzzle some viewers, but there are plenty of clever references, wig jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes, and cock gags to keep everyone laughing. The cameos are genius, and the 1690s aspect of the film fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the film. The writer believes that The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse has set a new benchmark for British comedy films.",1
"Jack, Kate, and Locke's groups encounter new characters on the island, including a physician and psychics who reveal they are not there to rescue the survivors. Ben Linus shoots anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis, while Jack's group finds a pilot who can repair their damaged helicopter. The second episode of the fourth season marks a return to the island and the end of confusing flash-forwards, promising explanations for the government's interest in Ben Linus and how he is informed from the boat. The reviewer rates the episode an eight out of ten.",1
"The family's happiness crumbles when the wealthy father becomes poor and the mother becomes the breadwinner. The father disowns his gay son, causing his daughter to run away and his other son to enlist in the marines. The film portrays sensitive situations and is best suited for a mature audience.",1
"""The Great Dictator"" is Chaplin's first talkie and a decent satire on Hitler, but Chaplin's tendency to use excessive dialogue detracts from the film's potential brilliance. Despite this, Chaplin's performance in dual roles is memorable and Paulette Goddard is still worth watching. Jack Oakie's portrayal of a rival dictator is also noteworthy.",1
"I watched a Mexican TV show about a real-life murder case of an All American family. At first, it seemed like the son, Walker, was the killer due to his differences with his father, but things turned out differently during a lie detector test. Later, Luke inherited $200,000 and bought a convertible. Despite the name changes, the movie is a great mystery that explores betrayal, ambition, and cold-bloodedness. The acting, direction, and plot are all of high quality.",1
"This sequel is a prime example of bad sequels. It is worse than the first movie in every aspect, including the actors, scenario, and special effects. It is a terrible movie and receives a rating of 0.5 out of 5 stars, only for comedic value.",0
"This comedy portrays living next to a racist bigot and reveals that both main characters are equally flawed. Despite its lack of plot, the politically incorrect film based on the hit ITV comedy is highly entertaining. The cast, particularly Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker, work well together and the movie still elicits genuine laughter. It is recommended for fans of the genre.",1
"The show was similar to NIGHT STALKER and X-FILES in setting up improbable situations for the main characters to solve, but unlike those shows, the heroes had tangible results. The characters were in a dirty profession and occasionally had to do nasty things. The show was good at grabbing the viewer's attention and setting up unexpected yet sensible explanations. The character Anabelle was competent and stood up to the male leads. Sullivan was coldly efficient and ruthless, while King saw it as a game and used it for his detective/spy novels. The spin-off series featuring only King lacked the interest of the original.",1
"Despite differing opinions in the comments, the author enjoyed the film and believes that good directing involves following the subject and keeping the story and actors together. The main character is intentionally annoying and the film requires patience. The author appreciated the photography, sets, and acting, particularly Guillaume Depardieu's portrayal of a character who is playing a role. The film provides enough information on all characters and the strange building is likely a refuge for fighters in a civil war, hinted at by Isabelle's story and Pierre's book collection.",1
"Wes Craven's film ""Chiller"" is not up to par with his other works, which suffered after ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" His subsequent films were mediocre or worse until ""People Under the Stairs"" brought him back to form. ""Chiller"" lacks Craven's usual suspense and regular cast, with only one good scene involving an old man's heart attack on the stairs.",0
"This film is one of the funniest comedies of the 90s with great writing, a satisfying story, and an excellent cast, including Chris Farley at his best.",1
"Critics who initially criticized ""Tommy Boy"" should revisit the film and recognize its comedic value. While Chris Farley may not have been on the same level as John Belushi or John Candy, he was still very funny. The movie stands out from other Farley and Spade collaborations and is one of the best comedies of the 1990s. It is unfortunate that Farley is no longer with us, but ""Tommy Boy"" serves as a reminder of his comedic talent.",1
"Don't miss this timeless masterpiece, with exceptional script, music, choreography, casting, and editing. Available on DVD with perfect transfer and enhanced sound. Despite being almost 25 years old, it still impresses with its maturity, art, and sensitivity. The only mystery is why the actors didn't achieve greater success after this brilliant start.",1
"This horror film is a masterpiece with zombies, grave snatching, and a great cast. The American actors with Irish/English accents were convincing, especially Larry Fessenden who was excellent in his role. The film is set in early 19th century Europe and is well crafted. It's highly recommended for a great time.",1
"While looking for something to watch during lunch, I stumbled upon a movie on the WE Network about a gymnastics team. I missed the beginning but caught up quickly, including a scene where Crystal admits to feeling responsible for her rapist's death. Despite enjoying Jenny Garth's performance, I felt bad for the actors due to the poorly written script. The wardrobe was also inaccurate, with outfits from the wrong time period. Overall, the movie is good for a laugh or for fans of Garth.",0
"The cinematic version of Carmen by Spanish director Vicente Aranda provides a more complete telling of the story of the wild gypsy girl created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845. The film follows the tempestuous Carmen, played by Paz Vega, and her doomed lover José, played by Leonardo Sbaraglia, as their passionate bond is tested by various incidents, including Carmen's affair with a bullfighter and the return of her real husband from prison. The incorporation of Mérimée as a main character adds depth to the story. The film features superb acting, cinematography, and musical score, making it a must-see for opera lovers and historical drama enthusiasts.",1
"The movie ""Fame"" is enjoyable because it allows us to imagine ourselves as music, dance, and drama students expressing ourselves. It is humorous and entertaining, and can inspire young people to pursue the performing arts. Overall, it deserves an 8 out of 10 rating.",1
"The movie is not a masterpiece, but it is entertaining and has aged with the times. The reviewer enjoyed it and found the acting average but suspenseful. Sandra Bullock's character as a computer genius was attractive. The reviewer's favorite movie of 1995, with a rating of 9/10.",1
"Emilio Estevez directs an engaging movie adaptation of the play HOMEFRONT with an exceptionally strong cast and top-notch acting. The smooth visual transitions and chilling sound effects add to the tension. The story's interesting characters and family dynamics remain even without the Viet Nam elements. THE WAR AT HOME is more direct than BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY and a fine effort, almost a 10.",1
"Despite altering reality for entertainment purposes, the film about Custer featuring Errol Flynn is the best one made. The music by Max Steiner is superb and the use of Custer's favorite song adds to the authenticity. The film could benefit from more villains, but the chemistry between Flynn and De Havilland is unmatched. Director Raoul Walsh excels in outdoor scenes with large casts.",1
"I expected a bad movie, but ""Blurred"" pleasantly surprised me. It's a relatable teen movie that reminded me of my own school experiences. Watching these types of movies can be entertaining and nostalgic, and can also help us understand our children better. I recommend giving this movie a try.",1
"The CKY crew consistently creates brilliant and foolish content, with Haggard being a prime example of comedic excellence despite its nonsensical nature. It's a must-have for fans of CKY and Jackass.",1
"Despite its preachy PC storyline about rape, this film has suspenseful moments and a standout performance from Ms. Beller. The plot drags on after the climax, but fans of 70s high school melodrama or Beller will enjoy it.",1
"The movie's first 10 minutes mock sequels and pg-13 movies, which are the main reasons for its poor quality. The film frequently references a movie called ""Get Leo,"" a movie-in-a-movie version of ""Get Shorty,"" which is frustrating. Travolta and Keitel are not cool, but The Rock and Vince Vaughn are funny, although not in the typical Elmore Leonard style. If you haven't seen ""Get Shorty,"" you may enjoy ""Be Cool,"" but if you have, you'll likely leave the theater angry at the director and screenwriter. It's best to wait for the DVD.",0
"Anthony Wong, known for his roles as a psychopathic weirdo in CATIII films, plays a man who seeks out a sorcerer for good dreams in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. However, the dreams come at a price and the sorcerer manipulates them to blackmail Wong and eventually kill him and his family. Wong's brother seeks revenge and with the help of the sorcerer's abused wife, turns the tables on the sorcerer. EROTIC NIGHTMARE is a more enjoyable and ""fun"" CATIII film compared to others in the genre, with plenty of nudity and gore. It is recommended for genre enthusiasts.",1
"Family Guy is a popular show that relies on irrelevant idiocy and repetitive jokes about sexual deviancy. Despite being praised for its edgy humor, it is actually dull, insulting, and uninspired. The show's attempts at being ""un-PC"" are not as daring as they claim to be. While it had some good moments, it is time for the show to end. The author still prefers it to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.",0
"Despite my anticipation of seeing two talented young actors in ""Dear John,"" the film was slow and hindered the lead performers due to the screenplay and direction. However, the movie did effectively portray realistic military action and the cinematography skillfully transitioned through love letters. Channing Tatum's performance was weighed down by a constant expression of sadness.",0
"The movie is set in London and is fantastic. It will be available on DVD in April 2003, and I plan to purchase it. The soundtrack, created by Saint Etienne, is exceptional.",1
"This adventure mini-series is top-notch and highly recommended. Sigrid's portrayal of Philadelphia is convincing and the production is excellent. It's worth watching all 400 minutes. Although I can't officially rate it, I give it a solid 10.",1
"WDR aired ""The General"" and ODC. ""The General"" was okay, but not great. ODC, starring Kevin Spacey, was confusing and lacked coherence. It tried to be cool like Guy Ritchie's films, but fell short. Overall, I would rate it 3 out of 10.",0
"The author was intrigued by Haneke as a filmmaker after reviewing Cache, which led them to watch La Pianiste. The film portrays a severely emotionally crippled character who represses her sexuality and struggles for autonomy. The bathroom scene is not erotic due to the prior scene revealing the character's disturbed nature. The film's ending is not neatly wrapped up, but there is a sense of finality. The author is now more intrigued by Haneke after watching La Pianiste.",1
"Canthony is right that the short film is only valuable for showcasing a young Judy Garland singing with Deanna Durbin. However, the running time is only ten minutes, not twenty. Despite the song not being Garland's best, the duet with Durbin is intriguing. The short is not great, but it is not as terrible as the other reviewer claimed. Overall, the author enjoyed it.",1
"The 1935 version of ""Enchanted April"" is both tedious and perfunctory, lacking the transformative magic of Italy and relying on stereotypical Italian behavior. The characters' transformation is sudden and underdeveloped, and the husbands are uninteresting. Jessie Ralph and Katharine Alexander give enjoyable performances, while Ann Harding is unremarkable due to the Production Code.",0
"The film accurately depicts the music industry and Harvey Keitel's performance as a producer torn between artistic integrity and commercial pressure is excellent. As someone who worked in the music industry, I can attest to its authenticity. I would purchase the uncut DVD if it became available.",1
"As someone with cerebral palsy, the reviewer doesn't want to give the film a free pass just because it tackles a rarely approached subject. They had minor issues with the film, such as unashamedly crowd-pleasing scenes and the late introduction of a terminal illness. However, the script also tackled tricky issues and showed daily apparatus used by non able-bodied people. The film is less sappy than expected and the interaction between the actors is special. The reviewer is happy that the film does justice to the lust for life of many disabled persons.",1
"The successful television show ""Doctor Who"" has returned with new episodes. The first two episodes, ""Rose"" and ""The End of the World,"" introduce the main character, Rose, who is saved by the Doctor from remote-controlled mannequins. They team up to save the world from plastic monsters and Rose decides to join the Doctor on his travels. Despite some weak special effects and choppy scenes, the show is well-written and predicted to be successful in the US.",1
"As a retired medical professional, I enjoy watching the film ""Hospital"" repeatedly. Paddy Chayefsky, a friend of my college composition teacher, visited our class in 1958 and his writing remains timeless. The supporting cast members went on to successful careers in TV and film. George Scott's comedic timing is comparable to Jackie Gleason and Steve Martin, and the film's humor is mental rather than physical. Despite containing only one four-letter word, it is still a family-friendly film.",1
"I frequently watch this film on TV, but forget to record it. Despite knowing the script, I still cry and enjoy the well-made, well-cast, and well-photographed film. It's one of my top ten favorites.",1
"I enjoyed the movie, which initially seemed like a typical French art film but then unexpectedly shifted into two separate plots. The twist was impressive, but the ending was confusing. The film was well-shot.",1
"After reading negative reviews, the author watched Mind of Mencia and found the criticisms to be accurate. The show relies on tired stereotypes and recycled jokes, including a rip-off of Jeff Foxworthy's ""You might be a redneck if..."" bit. The author suggests avoiding the show and instead watching comedians like Dave Chappelle who offer insightful humor about race and racism.",0
"Both parts of IVAN THE TERRIBLE were listed in the 50 Worst Movies book, but the second part is an improvement. The films were commissioned by Stalin to glorify him and excuse his reign, but even he didn't like them. The story of Ivan's life is incomplete, and the films feature overacting and long, boring scenes. However, there is one cool scene with Prince Vladimir at a banquet that is well-done and funny. The film uses a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor, which is odd for the 1940s.",0
"This is an excellent horror movie with a captivating story and a terrifying villain in Captain Howdy. The film is unique in that the villain becomes the hero, blurring the lines between good and evil. The two acts of the movie work well together and it is highly recommended for horror fans.",1
"Emilio is a successful businessman, father, and husband, but his carefully crafted facade begins to crumble. The film explores our fears about truly knowing those around us. The story builds tension as Emilio loses control of his lies. The technical proficiency and well-shot scenes make the actors believable, drawing the audience into Emilio's situation. The film is a realistic portrayal of Spain in 2002 and prompts viewers to consider the consequences of lies.",1
"By chance, the author discovered a TV show during a storm and ended up watching all the episodes. The cast, including John Hannah and Gerard Murphy, were excellent. The only downside was the limited number of episodes, and the author hopes to see the show return with John Hannah.",1
"The unexpected plot twist made me review the scenes for hints. I enjoyed the impressive performances of Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett, as well as the captivating story and haunting music.",1
"Brian Foster creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. for his boss, whose home security business is failing. A rival company hires two criminals to steal C.H.O.M.P.S., but they struggle to do so. The film is directed with a lighthearted tone and features a talented cast, including Valerie Bertinelli and Red Buttons. The titular pooch is a lovable character who performs impressive feats. The film also includes a subplot about a neighborhood dog named Monster. The opening credits, cinematography, and score are all well done. Overall, it is a cute children's movie.",1
"Ellen Gulden is the only convincing and likable character in the movie, with the exception of a sympathetic woman and the DA. However, the plot turns against itself by making the dying mother the ""one true thing"" in the eyes of her weak-willed husband. The one powerful scene where Ellen confronts her father's cruelty is undermined at the end, making the movie a bore and not worth watching.",0
"Peter Cushing's performance enhances this classic midnight movie with corny sci-fi elements. The sound design, including the choppy voices of creatures and rhino creatures, creates a strange atmosphere, complemented by the presence of a scantily clad woman.",1
The film about Stu Ungar is a tragedy in filmmaking history and is not recommended unless you have a specific interest in his life. It trivializes important parts and is unpleasant to watch.,0
"Although I am a fan of Steven Seagal, I did not understand the plot of this movie and was confused about the characters' allegiances. I hope his future films are more comprehensible. Nonetheless, my wife still finds him attractive in black jeans.",0
"ENCHANTED APRIL has a great story idea about two unhappy wives renting an Italian villa with two strangers, but the film is ruined by two bad performances. Ann Harding's portrayal is ridiculous and Reginald Owen's character is obnoxious and unbelievable. Despite the good plot and ambiance, these performances cannot be overlooked and undermine the rest of the film. A re-make is needed.",0
"The film is well-crafted with excellent cinematography and use of color. The director's work is fantastic and adds depth to the picture. The acting is suitable but the story lacks coherence and flow at times. Despite this, the film is recommended for its vision, visual flourish, and dark humor.",1
"The movie was mistakenly identified as being filmed in Russia, but it was actually filmed in Bulgaria. The author believes that American movies filmed in Bulgaria are generally of poor quality, including this one featuring Patrick Swayze. The movie lacks plot twists and energy, and is considered weak and boring.",0
"""The Man"" is a film about a boarding-house owner who takes in a troubled handyman who may be dangerous. Despite good performances from Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan, the film is unoriginal and visually dull with a small cast of characters. The direction is stilted and the film lacks the promised suspense. The screenplay was adapted by Mel Dinelli, who also co-produced the film.",0
"This story conveys multiple messages about success, failure, choices, self-realization, and determination. Each scene contains an element that stimulates the imagination. The sexually suggestive scenes are only meant to entertain and distract from character development.",1
"On New Year's Eve, a dying nurse requests to see David Holm, who is celebrating with his drunken friends in a cemetery. Holm tells a ghost story about a man who died on New Year's Eve and was condemned to drive Death's phantom chariot for a year. Ironically, Holm dies at midnight and witnesses the arrival of the phantom carriage and its driver, who turns out to be the man from his story. The film's special effects, including double-exposure photography, are impressive for its time. 'Körkarlen' is a haunting portrayal of Holm's descent into alcoholism, his judgment, and a possibility of redemption.",1
"Most posts on this site give a 10-star rating and rarely express dislike. However, the author is honest and dislikes the Rachel Ray show, finding it uninteresting and annoying. They prefer shows like ""Ham on the Street"" and Anthony Bourdain's work. The author also mentions that Rachel Ray has been cancelled.",0
"The author remembers a series of films from the 80s called ""Not Quite Human"" about a robot disguised as a human. They recommend watching the series if possible and ask if it has been shown recently.",1
"The movie is only 72 minutes long and if you can't figure out who the killer is, you haven't been paying attention to slasher movies for the past 20 years. Also, why is it that the non-nude actor is always the one people want to see naked?",0
"The film begins with a boat holiday, a married couple, an angry waiter, and a shipwreck. The main character's behavior of having sex with whoever has the most fish and playing the victim is frustrating. The movie involves a husband, another man, and a woman on a deserted island with moral issues and arguments. The acting is good, but the lack of moral values in the female character is sickening. The recommendation is to watch the movie to make other films seem more enjoyable.",0
"The film is highly enjoyable with great cameos, drug references, and music. The Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, containing the original 6 HBO episodes, should be rented before seeing the film in theaters to fully appreciate the inside jokes.",1
"The movie seen on TNT was initially corny and cheesy, but it turned out to be more of a comedy than an action/adventure. The most hilarious scene involved Kennedy shooting flares out the window to avoid missiles, but the flare gun malfunctioned and caused chaos. The movie lacked a plot and had too many love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. The final rating for the movie is 1 out of 10 stars if it were an action movie and 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy.",0
"Sharpe's Honour is the fifth installment in a TV movie series based on Bernard Cornwell's books about an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars. The story focuses on espionage, with Sharpe being falsely accused of murder and going on a secret mission to clear his name. The episode takes a more adventure-style approach, with Sharpe dodging French patrols and getting involved in daring escapes. The episode is a strong addition to the series, but not the best introduction for new viewers.",1
"As a huge Tolkien fan, the reviewer bases their critique of the movie on his books. While the movie is well-made with impressive effects and acting, it deviates too much from the original story and lacks character depth. The reviewer rates it 7+ / 10 as an adventure movie, but only 2 / 10 as an adaptation of Tolkien. They suggest that Peter Jackson should have labeled it as an adventure movie based on the Lord of the Rings.",0
"This film is terrible and the worst I've ever seen. Don't waste your time or money watching it. I rated it 1/10, which is too generous.",0
"The Hookers is a relatable story about everyday people trying to succeed, but facing temptations that can lead to setbacks. The author enjoyed the movie and even had a small role in it, playing the drums and showcasing their green Corvette. The cast and crew were wonderful, including James Coburn and Slim Pickens, who were down-to-earth and memorable. The author appreciates the film's focus on real people and thanks the filmmakers.",1
"In Sweden, a dying Salvation Army sister requests to see David Holm, but he cannot be found as he is spending New Year's Eve in a graveyard with his drinking buddies. In the graveyard, Holm tells the story of ""The Phantom Carriage"". The film, directed by Sjöström and photographed by Jaenzon, uses the ""double exposure"" effect effectively and has memorable dramatic highlights. However, the ending is a letdown and it is difficult to suspend disbelief in the story. Starring Sjöström, Borgström, and Svennberg.",1
"The Jazz Singer is one of several films made in the late 1940s and 1950s about the Jewish experience in the United States, often with a musical-theatre background. Non-Jewish actors were typically cast in leading roles to make the Jewish theme more accessible to non-Jewish audiences. The film follows a cantor's son who must choose between continuing the family tradition or pursuing a career in musical theatre, leading to conflict with his father. The film also portrays Jews as quintessentially American and loyal citizens, with no Eastern European accents. Peggy Lee's performance is noteworthy, and while the film is sentimental, it is worth watching.",1
"""Prime Suspect 4"" is a miniseries that follows Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison as she faces personal and professional challenges while seeking justice for victims. The series consists of three miniseries, with the absence of writer Lynda La Plante. Tennison battles both evil and good forces, making the scenarios of the series even grayer and her wars a matter of principle. The series improves with each installment. (B+)",1
"Many classic movies portrayed leading characters as liars, but the writer did not find this appealing, particularly in screwball comedies and Fred Astaire films. In this film, Barbara Stanwyck plays a magazine writer who lies to maintain her public persona and job, even about getting married. She pretends to be skilled in cooking and childcare, but her lies accumulate quickly. The writer finds the film unfunny, preferring Stanwyck's performances in film noir, and does not think highly of Dennis Morgan's acting.",0
"The writer is intrigued by ninjitsu and enjoyed the movie ""Ninja III"", which features a ninja seeking revenge through a possessed woman named Christie. Another ninja named Yamada comes to America to save Christie and put the vengeful ninja to rest. The fight scenes were impressive and the movie is recommended for martial arts enthusiasts. The writer gives it a 3 out of 5 stars.",1
"Initially, I did not plan to review this movie. However, while searching for the lead actor's name, I stumbled upon reviews and read them. Unfortunately, this movie is terrible, and I cannot fathom how anyone could enjoy it. The talented cast, including Caine, Gelbart, and Donen, were wasted, making it a cause for mourning rather than a guilty pleasure. It was a low point for everyone involved, except for Bologna, who may be trying to figure out which bomb ruined his career.",0
"This movie is enjoyable and funny, but avoid the TV version as it cuts out too much. Dom Deluise is great as the mafia Don hired to kill Robin. The rappers at the beginning and end are outdated and the songs are lame. Overall, it's a must-watch for comedy fans.",1
"Al Pacino used to act without relying on profanity, but now Matthew McConaughey has followed in his footsteps. However, this behavior is not acceptable in polite society and is seen as a lack of intelligence and disrespect. The movie they starred in was not good, and it is suggested that Pacino should take acting classes again. Rene Russo was the only standout performance.",0
"Despite recommendations and positive comments, the film purchased on eBay was disappointing due to average acting, poor editing, and lack of brilliance from director Wes Craven. While there were some creepy moments and effective music, overall the film was not great.",0
"Michelle Pfeiffer plays a mob widow in a colorful black comedy, with Matthew Modine as a clumsy FBI agent who likes her. Dean Stockwell is the standout as a persistent big shot, and Mercedes Ruehl is excellent as his jealous wife. The film has an eighties vibe, making it enjoyable, but it may not be for everyone.",1
"The writer has mixed feelings about the updated version of ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" compared to the original. While the new version lacks the same horror edge, it has some good aspects and is still enjoyable to watch. The first part of the movie is comedic and introduces the lead actress, Julie Delpy. The horror scenes are well done, and the lack of profanity is appreciated, but there are sexual remarks and a blasphemous scene. The heavy metal soundtrack may not appeal to older viewers, as the film is geared towards a younger audience. Overall, it's entertaining but not as good as the first film.",1
"The film lacked plot, action, suspense, drama, and scenery, but was still wonderful due to its understated nature, perfect acting, script, and casting. The reviewer plans to watch it again and recommends it to others. They give it a 9 out of 10.",1
The movie had good messages for kids but was predictable. The book had more plot details and humor. It may be too slow for kids under 6. The casting of Jimmy Buffet and the baby owls were highlights. The movie showcased Florida well. The author may have made a brief appearance.,1
"This film is so bad that no spoilers could make it worse. It is described as puerile and includes disgusting elements like dog poo and mucous. The cast, including Johnny Vegas, made a poor decision in participating.",0
"This film showcases the talents of many black performers, some of whom have passed away, and allows us to appreciate their abilities. It is a valuable historical document and belongs to the people of this country due to its educational value. The sound and quality of the film are good, and there are no negative views. The reviewer requests that the movie be made available to everyone for its historical significance.",1
"The movie was enjoyable, but despite being a mystery fan, I couldn't guess the killer. The Gerda character's portrayal was not ideal, but it may have been accurate for the time period. The Poirot movies lack the same dynamic as the series without Japp, Ms. Lemon, and Hastings. David Suchet is the best Poirot actor, while Peter Ustinov was the worst.",1
"The film is a high budget production by Paramount that follows the story of Jack Shepard, a locksmith turned highwayman in 1700's London. After being double-crossed, he becomes a Robin Hood figure and gains the support of the common folk. The film was shot in Ireland and captures the bustling atmosphere of London in the 1700's. It shows the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived. Although lacking in political commentary, the film is enjoyable and deserves a viewing. It has not been released on video or DVD.",1
"House of the Dead 2 fails to meet the basic requirements of a good zombie movie, lacking in special effects, gore, scares, and plot. The dialogue is infamous and the special effects are embarrassing. The movie was filmed on a low budget and the female soldiers are all models. The characters are clueless and allow the zombies to kill them. This movie is worse than even the worst Scifi Channel movies.",0
"If you appreciate visual arts, you will enjoy this great movie. The two daughters' painted and photographed scenery is stunning, and the story is both humorous and touching. It is an art movie that will appeal to fans of European and art films. Rent it now.",1
"Raymar, a lethal telekinetic psychic vampire, dies under strange circumstances. Julie Wells, a high school student, wants to be accepted by a snobby clique and agrees to spend a night in a mausoleum where Raymar's body is interred. Raymar still has his powers, making it a terrifying night for Julie. The film creates an eerie atmosphere but is slow and uneventful in the first hour. Despite its flaws, the film has endearing 80s charm, impressive cinematography, makeup effects, and a macabre finale.",1
"Commander's Log is a low-budget science fiction show that was presented at a local convention by Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks, and Brian Oberquell. The show is compared to Red Dwarf and relies on good writing and acting due to its lack of ""eye candy"". Originally intended to be shown in two-minute interstitials, the show was instead aired as a one-hour program in two half-hour episodes. The existing DVD does not include episodes 3 and 4, but screenings may be available through the fannish community.",1
"The paragraph describes a movie that combines elements of Christ mythology, pornography, bad sci-fi, blackxploitation, after school specials, kung fu fighting, and break dancing, with a Casio keyboard soundtrack. The movie includes multiple rape scenes, a car explosion, and a buff black man running around in his underwear with an Uzi. The author suggests that the movie is so bad that it can only be enjoyed with copious amounts of alcohol.",0
"John Carpenter's sci-fi horror film is a masterful blend of the body-swap theme and Cold-War paranoia, set in the isolated Antarctic. Carpenter's direction is excellent, with surreal gore and special effects, while still maintaining the human element of trust and suspicion. It is a remake of the 1951 original produced by Howard Hawks. The film is rated 9/10.",1
"As a former Marine, I can confirm that the movie D.I. accurately portrays Marine boot camp and the transformation of boys into men. Jack Webb plays the role of Sgt. Jim Moore, a strict but just drill instructor in Paris Island, North Carolina. The film focuses on a recruit who struggles to adapt. Another recommended film that depicts basic training is Full Metal Jacket.",1
Lynch's failed TV pilot was completed with a mix of everything and lacks a deeper meaning. The concept of building up a mystery and then revealing nothing is repeated in Lynch's work. The audience's serious discussion of a comedian's nonsensical opera performance is similar to the deeper meaning search for Lynch's work. The movie has a 0/10 rating.,0
"Companies in Romania are only taking pictures of old cars and not the newer, more expensive ones. They are also filming in neighborhoods where they can manipulate the environment and dress people in outdated clothing to make them look foolish. The author wishes for future movies to be made in the US instead of Romania to avoid embarrassment for the country.",0
"'National Velvet (1944)' is a heartwarming story with a good moral, despite occasional unconvincing moments. Elizabeth Taylor's acting abilities were limited at age 12, but she works well with Mickey Rooney. The film effectively captures the nervous tension of the Grand National Sweepstakes race sequence. The positive message of the film has inspired millions of young girls over the last sixty years.",1
"Wayne Wang's direction and the chemistry between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman make this film more impressive than ""Slums of Beverly Hills"". The dysfunctional life of the two women is portrayed without causing depressed frustration. Susan Sarandon's character is a narcissistic parent who manages to avoid being floridly insane or intentionally sadistic. Natalie Portman's character is an intelligent codependent child with dignity under stress. The film has a satisfying resolution and is recommended for those who want to be challenged and entertained.",1
"""National Velvet"" is a film about a young English girl, Velvet Brown, who dreams of entering her horse into the Grand National race. With the help of a former jockey and her parents, she trains her horse for the competition. The film appeals to the entire family and received five Oscar nominations, including a win for Anne Revere's performance as Velvet's mother. Elizabeth Taylor, at 12 years old, steals the show with her charming presence and talent beyond her years. The film's Technicolor and editing are attractive, and it was also nominated for direction, cinematography, and art direction. The score by Herbert Stothart is noteworthy. Despite the subject matter, ""National Velvet"" is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating.",1
"""Late Chrysanthemums"" is a character-driven film by Mikio Naruse that follows the lives of three ex-geishas in post-war Japan. The women's strained relationship is complicated by one woman's success as a moneylender, while the other two rely on their children for income. The film is slow-moving, but Naruse's ability to do much with very little makes it a worthwhile watch. Despite its cynicism, Naruse sympathizes with his characters and paints vivid portraits of their self-made misery. The film is important as a fragment of the work of a great but little-known director.",1
"I enjoyed the Millenium series and bought the film, but it was a mistake as it is a typical bad mutant/monster movie. The idea is not completely unsuccessful, but the execution makes it a B-class movie. The scary scenes are more comical and the creature is not believable. However, watching it with friends in a playful mood makes it unintentionally funny.",0
"The media's portrayal of ""lesbian"" movies is disappointing, often featuring negative stereotypes. However, FINGERSMITH stands out as a well-acted and believable love story with engaging conflict. It surpasses TIPPING THE VELVET in character development and acting quality, and is a satisfying and enjoyable watch for lesbians, following in the footsteps of BOUND.",1
"The film adaptation of John Irving's novel, starring Robin Williams, attempts to depict a man's growth from birth to adulthood and his struggles with lust and fanaticism. However, the film's quirky and bittersweet sketches end up being absurd, and Williams' talent is wasted on a script that doesn't suit his wildness and anarchy. The movie attracted attention in 1982 due to Williams' popularity, but audiences were confused by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.",0
"Despite recognizing Jennifer Lynch's name and the 18 certificate, I found the film to be a farce with atrocious acting and a bad script. The little girl character named Stephanie gave the best performance, but overall, the film is violent without point and plain silly. I cannot recommend it to anyone.",0
"I expected to rate this movie poorly, but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Despite tacky characters, cheap effects, and unimpressive monsters, I found it somewhat entertaining, possibly due to its humor. It's worth a three-star rating.",0
"The young age of director and script writer Dan Harris must be considered when evaluating 'Imaginary Heroes', but the film is a mature and professional work with some routine flaws. The story revolves around a family coping with the suicide of their talented son and brother, portrayed by Emile Hirsch. Sigourney Weaver plays the mother and both actors deliver excellent performances. The tension builds in the first two sections of the film, but the second part is disappointing and conventional, possibly due to producer interference. Despite this, Harris shows promise and is likely to make a name for himself in the future.",1
"Heather Graham is not only beautiful but also entertaining to watch in this movie, which features a great cast that works well together. Casey Affleck is funny, and Heather Graham shines on screen. The supporting actors, Goran Visnjic and Patricia Velazquez, are both talented and attractive. Miramax and Director Lisa Krueger deserve congratulations.",1
"This film has elements reminiscent of Bunuel, but fails to hold one's attention. A 10-year-old drives a stolen Mustang through a strange America, while familiar cult movie actors engage in comedic acts of malice. The screenwriter, known for uncomfortable films like AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, enjoys making audiences squirm, but the exaggerated acting left me unimpressed. Even Meat Loaf and Flea's performances were more appealing than the insufferable child actor. This movie is only recommended for fans of SONNY BOY ('87).",0
"Terry and June is a classic British sitcom that stands out from modern shows with contrived plots and dysfunctional families. It features a middle-class couple living in relative harmony, and is a breath of fresh air compared to shows that rely on bodily function jokes and perpetually late families. The ""Bridge to far"" episode is particularly good, with Terry's antics reminiscent of Basil Fawlty. Highly recommended for a cozy viewing experience with tea and biscuits.",1
"Ms. Stowe delivers a remarkable performance in a powerful drama where a secret policeman interrogates a children's author for allegedly planting anti-state ideas in her writing. The film's message and both performances deserve more recognition, making it a must-see if available.",1
"I was hesitant to watch Blade due to disappointment with previous comic book movies. However, Blade exceeded my expectations with its accurate portrayal of the story, violence, martial arts, and good vs. evil theme. The film was well-made and never boring. Blade II was good, but not as good as the first. Overall, Blade is one of the best comic book movies I've seen in a while.",1
"The movie is disliked, but better than its sequels. The humor and relationship development are repetitive. The setting in South Africa is unrealistic. Hollywood repeats itself with similar storylines. The action scenes are over the top and the plot is predictable. The movie receives a 3/10 rating.",0
"Lucasarts has once again produced an excellent game, proving their dominance in the gaming genre. Concerns about the game's ability to maintain its humor were quickly dispelled upon playing. The game is filled with jokes from start to finish and lives up to the high standards set by previous Lucasarts works. It is highly recommended.",1
"Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty (2000) marks his transition from indie to mainstream cinema, while still maintaining his unique style. The film features A-list Hollywood actors, but the material remains quirky and bizarre. The story follows a naive waitress who falls in love with a soap star and sets out to meet him after her husband is murdered by hitmen. The film is a dark comedy and one of the most absurd movies in recent years. LaBute's recurring theme of vulnerable women being taken advantage of is present, but he deals more harshly with the abusers. The supporting cast includes Crispin Glover, Allison Janney, and Kathleen Wilhoite. The script is over-the-top, and the ending may be too perfect, but the film is still great.",1
"The movie is a bad adaptation of a great book, which I highly recommend for children, but I cannot recommend the movie.",0
"As a central European, I find the show comparable to Married with Children and believe it is not suitable for conservative audiences. Despite my own conservative views, I appreciate the humor and moral lessons in the show. It is unfortunate that there are only two seasons and I hope it continues. Unlike other comedies, there are no sad or unfunny moments in the show, making it similar to The Simpsons and Married with Children.",1
"Irwin Allen wrote, produced, and directed a cartoonish ""epic"" about an atomic submarine trying to reduce a ring of radiation around the Earth. Despite an interesting cast, the potentially exciting story falls flat and the sci-fi is cheesy. It provides a few laughs but lacks strong adventure. It later became a popular TV series.",0
"The movie has appealing characters, great animation, catchy songs, and adorable cats. It is humorous without any threatening elements, making it suitable for children. The two farm dogs are memorable despite their limited screen time. The linear style of the artwork may not be for everyone, but it is charming to the reviewer.",1
"The message of the film is that irrational hatred is a waste of life, as demonstrated by Fred's actions towards Lawrence. The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein highlights the consequences of bigotry. The film's details, such as the propaganda poster and graffiti, also convey important messages. The film should be included in school curriculums to combat the promotion of baseless hatred.",1
"""Campfire Tales"" is a horror anthology film consisting of three spooky stories told by a group of friends who get into a car crash in the woods after a concert. As they wait for help, they tell classic horror stories that become increasingly terrifying. The last story is the scariest, with a twist ending. The film is worth watching and better than expected, with recognizable cast members. Overall, it's a great anthology of classic urban legends.",1
"Despite enjoying Neil Gaiman's writing in the past, Mirrormask was a disappointment. While the live-action section was intriguing and well-done, the subsequent computer-generated scenes were awkward and lacked plot coherence. It is recommended to stick with Gaiman's written work instead.",0
"This movie differs from others about the death penalty by emphasizing the suffering of victims' parents and presenting a Christian perspective. The convicted man is not portrayed as innocent, and the emotional weight of the execution is highlighted through parallel cuts with murder scenes. The movie suggests that legal executions are no different from murder.",1
"The film ""Punishment Park"" was unexpectedly discovered and initially believed to be a real documentary, causing a strong emotional reaction. It felt very realistic and led to negative feelings towards America, until it was later discovered to be a work of fiction.",1
"The movie, produced by Bey, has an international feel and was filmed in Vienna. Bey was great in Universal adventure movies and in a thrilling movie called ""The Amazing Mr. X."" However, this movie is wooden and difficult to follow, with a disappointing plot. Lederer looks great as a concert pianist but the movie is heavy going.",0
"The short film features a harsh writing teacher whose blunt criticism affects his personal life, but he eventually learns the importance of diplomacy and gains insight into the art of writing.",1
"Sean Connery plays the Great Raisuli in an adventure movie featuring Arabs, Germans, and the USMC. The story is based on a true incident of a kidnapping, but the victims have been changed to Candace Bergen and her children. The movie includes humor and famous political quotations from the TR era. Brian Keith says ""Pedecaris alive or the Raisuli dead!"" and John Huston asks the Japanese Ambassador, ""You likee knifee, you likee forkee?"" at a White House dinner.",1
"This movie is perfect for summer and despite being silly and outdated, it still made my kids laugh. It follows the typical plot of the underdogs fighting against the establishment, making it predictable but enjoyable. Although Bill Murray is not at his best, it was his first leading role and he shows potential. Surprisingly, few of the young actors in the film went on to have successful careers.",1
"The Greatest Game Ever Played is a film about Francis Ouimet, a 20-year-old son of an immigrant family living in the United States during the late 19th to early 20th century. Despite class limitations, Francis uses his golf skills to follow in the footsteps of his idol, British gold champion Harry Vardon, and compete in the 1913 US Open. The film is not just about golf, but also about breaking class barriers and following one's dreams. The cast, costumes, and sets are excellent, and the film is directed with heart and attention to detail by Bill Paxton.",1
"The movie has an interesting concept but suffers from poor execution in both the script and direction. The protagonist, Miles, undergoes a life restoration surgery but lacks a soul, which explains his erratic behavior and indirect responsibility for two deaths. Despite some enjoyable elements, such as Miles' love for brandy and his cousin, the movie's producer and scriptwriter, J.D. Feigelson, failed to bring the idea to life. The score is minimal, and the movie deserves its late-night TV time slot. While the movie is a good example of how to ruin a career in acting or scriptwriting, it is not recommended.",0
"Despite liking S Segal, the movie is disappointing with an unbelievable plot and actions below Segal's standards. The only good part is Segal's performance. The reviewer believes they could write a better script for Segal and the only realistic part is the bad guy getting away. The spoiler reveals laughable scenes such as disecting a black-box recorder in a hotel room and a gas leak.",0
"Despite initial skepticism, this alien abduction movie is worth watching as it effectively suspends disbelief. The main character being a doctor adds credibility to his belief in alien abduction, and Vosloo's sensitive portrayal of his confusion and pain is engaging. While the special effects are sparingly used, they are shocking. However, the plot wanders at times and the ending is disappointing. The supporting characters are weak or menacing, detracting from the overall experience. The movie raises interesting issues, including the concept of ""lost time"" and animal experimentation.",1
"Combining drama and comedy is difficult, but LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE Muslim WORLD succeeded with a great script and Albert Brooks' performance. However, MAN OF THE YEAR fails with a messy message, forced jokes, and an unbelievable love story. The premise of a Jon Stewart-like comedian running for president is promising, but the execution is awkward. The film's message about special interests owning presidential candidates is interesting, but the movie doesn't effectively convey it as a comedy.",0
"This classic movie serial remains captivating despite its dated appearance. The second installment is visually superior but lacks the charm of the original. Middleton and Lipson deliver standout performances, and the Universal editing team excels. The musical score, compiled from various Universal films, adds to the excitement. This serial could be considered the top choice for all-time best.",1
"Shameless Screen Entertainment is a new British DVD-label that specializes in smutty and violent cult movies, mostly Italian ones from the late 60's to mid-80's. They have released rare Italian films like ""Ratman"", ""My Dear Killer"", ""Killer Nun"", ""Phantom of Death"" and ""Torso"". ""The Frightened Woman"" is a weird film that is not suitable for most audiences, but if you appreciate moody and sexy ambiances, bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches, it is a top recommendation. The story revolves around a rich doctor who kidnaps and sexually abuses women, but falls for a journalist he abducts.",1
"The film is a powerful critique of war in general, not just the specific war during which it was made. It follows a married couple, former orchestra musicians, living on an island who are forced to confront the realities of war when it comes to their doorstep. The film does not take sides and instead focuses on the impact of war on ordinary people. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow give excellent performances as a couple whose marriage is tested by the violence and chaos of war. The film is a poignant and emotional exploration of the human cost of war and the toll it takes on individuals and relationships.",1
"Liev's directorial debut ""Everything Is Illuminated"" impressed me with its successful adaptation of the book's nonsensical vocabulary and dreamlike sequences. Despite missing some story elements, the movie's soundtrack, performances, and cinematography all work well. However, the lack of promotion for the film is disappointing, and I only found out about it through a trailer on another DVD. Nonetheless, I highly recommend watching it for a great experience. I give it an 8 out of 10.",1
"After watching the latest episode in the UK, I believe it's difficult to maintain the show's quality. ""Blink"" had Gothic horror elements involving deceptive statues, with minimal appearances from the Doctor and Martha. Despite this, it was well-crafted and part of a high standard set by the last three episodes, including ""The Family"" two-parter. The entire cast, not just David Tennant, contributes to the show's success. Those waiting for series 3 overseas will find it worth the wait.",1
"The film delves into the experience of being accused of subversion through two characters, one being the accused and the other the interrogator. It is a scary journey and may not be understood by those unfamiliar with political systems, as evidenced by most reviews.",1
"The book is great, but the movie with Kylie Minogue was disappointing and lacked passion. Kylie was not a good fit for the feisty Lola character and there was no chemistry between her and Charlie Schlatter. The movie was boring and focused too much on Kylie.",0
"Stefan, a German freshman, hitchhikes to Paris and falls for a mysterious woman in the freak scene. He follows her to Ibiza where they meet Wolf, who owns bars and hotels and keeps Estelle under his control with drugs. Stefan becomes addicted and jealous of Estelle, who is a free spirit. The film has great photography and music, but is cold and dramatic. It emphasizes drug use but is not an exploitation film and has a strong moral message.",1
"The writer watched a movie on TCM and was surprised by how engaging it was. The film features Bogart as a cynical editor who reluctantly goes along with his greedy boss to boost ratings by airing a tell-all radio series about a woman who was acquitted of killing her husband. The movie also provides insight into workplace gender dynamics in the mid-1930s. The supporting cast is unfamiliar to the writer, but they were all excellent, and the direction was taut. The writer recommends the movie to fans of similar films like A Face In The Crowd and An Inspector Calls.",1
"This early sci-fi movie is only worth watching for its campy elements. The dialogue is filled with ridiculous scientific jargon and the female character is only there to be objectified. However, the musical score is well-done and the special effects are decent for the time period. The acting is passable, but the lines given to the actors are so absurd that it's a wonder they didn't burst out laughing.",0
"Despite not being a fan of British drama, I was deeply moved by the characters and their poor decisions in this film's London premiere. The attention to detail and acting were impressive, and while Keira Knightley radiated beauty and innocence, Sienna Miller's performance was Oscar-worthy. However, I agree with others who question why women were attracted to such a despicable character, and I had hoped for his demise. This production is likely to receive other award nominations.",1
"The mini-series ""North and South"" aired from 1985 to 1987 and was based on John Jake's novels. It follows the story of Orry Main, a plantation-born man from South Carolina, and George Hazard, a Yankee from the North, who become friends despite the turbulent era leading to the Civil War. The series covers major Civil War scenes and features cameos from veteran Hollywood actors. While it is historical fiction, it provides entertainment with cliffhanger endings, beautiful cinematography, costumes, and locations. The acting may not be the best, but some performances are noteworthy. Fans of Civil War movies and the Jakes novels should watch this.",1
"A family of farmers moves to Walnut Grove, where Charles works at the mill and the town is run by the wealthy but foolish Olsons. The preacher is disliked and the doctor is old but provides free breast exams. Charles' wife and three daughters also live in town, including Mary who is attractive and Half-Pint who can spit far. The town is small and dangerous, but has a church/school-house/town hall/pool room. Nellie is also attractive and fun to spy on while bathing in the creek.",0
"The success of the movie Closet Land is attributed to the exceptional acting of Stowe and Rickman, despite the challenge of filming in one room with only two characters. It may not appeal to those who prefer action-packed films, but those who appreciate good storytelling should watch it.",1
This thriller is a poor imitation of 'Deliverance' lacking charm and intelligence. The plot is absurd and the cast appears disinterested. It exemplifies a terrible plot and a terrible idea. It's unfortunate to see talented actors like Thomerson and James in such a mess.,0
"The French have improved their Asterix movies with better special effects in Mission Cleopatra, which is the best Asterix story ever written. The movie is entertaining, but deviates from the original comic in some parts. The music choice is too childish, but overall it is a must-see.",1
"The movie is a pleasant surprise with impressive animation in the opening credits. Despite its low budget, the characters are well-developed, and the horror scenes are intense with great makeup effects. The film has a tongue-in-cheek humor that is typical of 80s horror movies. It is recommended for horror fans and can be paired with the 1999 remake of ""House on the Haunted Hill"" due to similarities in set-up and character dynamics.",1
"The DVD was purchased for Julia Ormond's performance, which was impressive, but Bill Paxton's acting was lackluster. Julia's proficiency in French was evident in the film 'Sabrina', but she was chosen for a Dutch film about Belgium in World War 2 over a native French speaker. The film had an odd nature and was out of season. The plot was a mess and unrealistic, with many historical inaccuracies. The film could have been improved with a better script.",0
"Despite the abundance of stupid comedies from various eras that have received DVD treatment, this film, which features talented individuals such as Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal, and Dustin Hoffman in his debut, has been unfairly neglected and was not even released on VHS. It reflects the tastes and customs of the sixties, but has many memorable bizarre, goofy, and wacky moments that create its own absurd universe. It deserves a DVD release and gets the author's vote.",1
"In this episode, Captain Picard, Commander Riker, and Lieutenant Tasha Yar wear formal dress uniforms while dealing with two groups of alien delegates who hate each other and try to capture and eat each other. Riker and Tasha must contain them while a mysterious spacial anomaly injures and kills crew members, ultimately possessing a valuable member of the crew. Irish actor Colm Meaney makes his second appearance on TNG as one of Tasha's security guards.",1
"Leland P. Fitzgerald stabs his ex-girlfriend's mentally disabled brother and no one knows why. In detention, he meets Pearl Madison who wants to understand his motivation. The film jumps between past and present, showing how Leland's crime affects those around him. Ryan Gosling gives a standout performance as Leland. The characters are flawed and there are no heroes in this complex movie.",1
"Bond films are evaluated based on how well they meet expectations, and there are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film. NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not part of the official Bond filmography, but Sean Connery's return as 007 makes it more than an honorary member. The film rates 78 out of 100 on the Bond-o-meter, with strong performances from Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera, and damsel-in-distress Basinger, but lacking in areas such as the opening credits and theme song.",1
"A Brief History of Time is a documentary that tells the story of Stephen Hawking, reflecting the history of the universe. The editing style includes quick fades to black, giving the impression of Hawking's viewpoint. Despite its short running time, the subject matter is vast and fascinating.",1
"The production value is average, with attractive actors and a traditional filming style. However, the premise is frustrating and portrays women negatively. The film also perpetuates negative stereotypes about Eastern Europeans. Overall, it is a tasteless and degrading movie.",0
"The storyline is wordy and lacks character development, and it reinforces negative black stereotypes, leading the reader to question if Jesse Helms was involved in writing the screenplay.",0
"""Hick Trek - The Moovie"" is a 60-minute comedy film that parodies the Star Trek genre by featuring a group of rednecks trying to stop a group of cats from destroying the Redneck Federation. The film is full of humorous moments and has become a cult classic among party-goers.",1
"Having read all of Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them, I believe the 1980's version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour was superior to this one. The new adaptation is less light-hearted and lacks depth, with excessive focus on violence. While the acting is decent, the script is lacking. The costumes are a highlight.",0
"The first twenty minutes of the film evoke powerful emotions through the portrayal of realistic characters and music performances. The film delves deeper into exploring the repressed sexuality of a piano teacher and the cycle of abuse. The graphic scenes of sex and brutality are essential to the film's themes, but may not be suitable for all viewers. The film is great, but not mainstream.",1
"This movie is hilariously bad with terrible acting, dialogue, and plot. It has multiple titles to protect those involved. Despite being rented for Heather Graham, the movie is not scary and is a waste of money. The few no-name actors provide some unintentional comedy, but overall it is not worth watching. Heather Graham's dramatic climax is pathetic and disturbing. The movie is terrible and receives no points.",0
"The movie is about unstable young people in a car and starts off okay but gets weirder. Rachel Leigh Cook's performance is good, but the movie is only recommended for her fans.",0
"The movie is terrible and trying to base it on the first one is a joke. The use of one-liners from the original, delivered by classic actors like Sam Elliot, was a letdown. The new characters' attempts to use these lines fell flat. The movie should have been called a ""Roadhouse wannabe.""",0
"The second Lone Ranger movie is not as good as the 1956 classic, but still has plenty of action and a fast pace. The Ranger investigates a series of murders targeting peaceful Indians, with racial insensitivity present in the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises to solve the case and bring the outlaws to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels star in a colorful presentation set in old Tucson. The music score is good, but lacks the traditional William Tell Overture theme.",1
"I enjoy the character of Jack Frost in the movie sequel, and appreciate the change in setting to a tropical resort. The actor who plays Jack Frost does a great job as a villain and the CGI is good. However, I have a complaint about the appearance of the Jacklings. Overall, the movie is worth watching and I give it 9 stars. If you liked the first movie, you will enjoy this one.",1
"As a Doctor Who fan, I was disappointed with the new series. It may be enjoyable for children under 15 or new fans, but those familiar with the original series will find it lacking. Only die-hard fans or those unfamiliar with the original series should watch it.",0
"The movie had elements of Gary Larson's humor and illustration style, borrowed from Aardman and Pixar, featured Lion King-like villains in an elephant graveyard in farm country, and included an outdated Riverdance joke. The kids enjoyed it, but the dad found it lacking in character design, rendering, script, and direction. It was another unsuccessful attempt by Nickelodeon Films to capitalize on the animation trend.",0
"Sam Elliot delivers a great performance as Detective Charlie Fallon, who, after his partner's death, kills their informant and disposes of the body. Despite being assigned a new partner and tasked with investigating the murder, Fallon struggles with guilt and grief over his actions and his partner's possible involvement in police corruption.",1
"The writer planned to see the movie but couldn't, then saw it with a friend and enjoyed it. The movie is about a heist in Italy, with a group of guys stealing gold bricks. One member turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills the leader. A year later, the leader's daughter helps the group get revenge. The movie has action and humor, with an ongoing joke about a character creating Napster. The only negative is Edward Norton's weak acting. The writer recommends the movie and gives it four out of five stars.",1
"The film introduced me to Chris Cooper's talent and his character as a Union Captain impressed me. The accurate portrayal of Eastern Kentucky's divided sentiments during the Civil War is explored in this drama, which delves into the psychology of people at war. It is the best study of how divided loyalties affected the interaction of peoples in the border states.",1
"The movie was confusing and jumped around, leaving the viewer unsure of what was happening. Despite enjoying the actors and scenery, the ending was also unclear. The viewer would like to read the book to understand what was missed, but does not believe the movie will receive any awards.",0
"This review may contain spoilers for those unfamiliar with the book or movie. The acting between the leads is excellent, but the production values are not top-notch. The film simplifies some relationships and adds unrealistic tension for plot purposes, which is handled better in the book. The end of the book is more touching than the end of the movie.",1
"Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever, despite Plan 9 From Outer Space. Coleman Francis is worse, as evidenced by Glen or Glenda. The first half of the movie explores crossdressing thoughtfully, but the acting is wooden and the middle dream sequence is bizarre. However, the movie is still watchable without assistance from robots.",0
"Alice encounters a world of wonder with characters like the Mad Hatter and the Queen who show her things about her body and others' bodies. Kristine DeBell plays Alice and is considered the most attractive adult actress of her time. The songs in the movie are cheesy but fit the theme, and the trial at the end is well-scripted. This film has a plot and music, which may be overwhelming for those used to adult films with only a short lead-in to sex. It is a special film that could become a cult classic.",1
"This movie, directed by Kevin Tenney, is a unique blend of Pin and Child's Play. While not as good as those films, it still has good actors and a scary Pinocchio puppet. The plot is predictable but the child actress is impressive and there is a memorable shower scene. Overall, it's a decent B-movie.",1
"Uncle Frank and Matthew Ginsburg's film educates and entertains viewers about the struggles of elderly Americans, making it a must-see from a promising filmmaker.",1
"Although lacking in extravagant action scenes, this film boasts exceptional acting and a remarkable script, making it a must-see indie film. The performances of Taylor Nichols and James Remar are particularly noteworthy, and the young cast delivers consistent acting without any weak links. Overall, an impressive film worth watching.",1
"This film is good but different from Seagal's usual movies, which may disappoint some fans. It's not solely focused on Seagal's character and his actions are unique. The concept of him being an intellectual is refreshing. Although there are unrealistic parts, the film is enjoyable. If you're looking for a classic Seagal action film, you may be disappointed, but it's still worth watching. It's some of his best work in a while.",1
"This film is unique and not comparable to ""Mad Max"". It takes place in post-apocalyptic Paris and follows a man's fight for survival in a world where he cannot speak and women are scarce. Luc Besson is praised for the film.",1
"This TV series deserves a 10+ rating due to excellent writing and talented actors, particularly Ms. Toussaint and Ms. Potts who had a genuine relationship on and off camera. The show teaches valuable lessons about historical struggles, relationships, and everyday situations, making it a wonderful family show. The reviewer has taped most episodes and watches them repeatedly.",1
"Although not a movie expert, I found this film to be well-acted and powerful, albeit lacking subtlety. It effectively recreated the feeling of watching a stage play, which added to its eerie atmosphere. The absence of spatial landmarks made it relatable to any political situation. Overall, it was a powerful experience that should be appreciated.",1
"The film did not evoke an emotional response from the author due to poor scripting and lack of character development. A remake with better writers could greatly improve it, as seen in the success of Brokeback Mountain. However, the film's daring subject matter saves it from receiving a 1-star rating.",0
"The film I saw in Madrid had an impressive performance by Gallo, but was otherwise dull and poorly made. Kilmer's role was minimal and his top billing was insulting. The director's other films were also below average, but worth watching for Gallo fans. Others should avoid it.",0
"The film has a great cast including Sutherland, Lane, and Chris Evans, and it's unclear why it hasn't been released yet. The story is based on the author's experiences growing up as the ""poor kid"" in a wealthy community where class affects every aspect of life. During a Q&A, the author revealed that the ultra-rich are not stupid, but rather a threat with plans. The film is timely.",1
"Despite being a terrible film with a low budget, it has a few creepy scenes and unintentionally funny moments. It falls into the ""so bad it's entertaining"" category and is worth watching for that reason alone. The effects and acting are bad, but it has a nostalgic charm. The Alpha DVD print adds to the overall experience.",0
"I watched the film alone and skipped most of it due to the bad script and acting. The photography and directing were partially good, but not enough to save the film. The love scenes were dull and the characters were unlikable. If you like Survivor, you may enjoy this movie, otherwise avoid it.",0
"I enjoyed this movie when it played frequently on Disney Channel, but my taste may have changed since then. It was a 7/10 with good music. Fans are curious about a song played during a car crash scene, ""Play a Love Song"" by the Jaguars, which is difficult to find. The movie is also hard to find online or on physical media. I would like to watch it again to see if it still holds up.",1
"The opening scene featuring Traci Lords in a techno bar is amazing and the best vampire movie with great fight scenes. Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff give impressive performances. It's a great movie with a 9/10 rating, but the sequel Blade II is missing.",1
"The Oscar-winning short film, based on a William Faulkner short story, follows two brothers in small-town Tennessee in December 1941. After the older brother enlists in the military, the younger brother follows suit, showing his determination and devotion. The film highlights the importance of family ties and delivers a cathartic ending. It is a good, clear film that quenches your thirst, but not as expensive or pure as others. It gets the job done and leaves you refreshed. 7/10.",1
"Christian Duguay directed a thrilling espionage movie where naval officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to impersonate Carlos the Jackal. The movie has some violent and sexual scenes that were unfortunately trimmed for TV. Quinn's superiors, played by Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, train and indoctrinate him in the first half of the movie, while the second half has him out in the field making love to the Jackal's woman and shooting it out with enemies. The plan is to make the Jackal look like a turncoat to the Russians, but things don't go as planned. The movie is a fun flick that deserves attention, with the Jackal's former mistress teaching Quinn to rough her up, lick blood from her face, and then go down on her being a standout scene.",1
"This movie highlights Drew Barrymore's acting skills as she portrays an unattractive high school student, a role that is unexpected for her. Despite not typically enjoying uplifting films, the movie provided plenty of humor and was thoroughly enjoyed.",1
"Rae, a high school nymphomaniac, hooks up with Ronnie before he leaves for National Guard duty. After being beaten and left for dead by a friend, she is rescued by Lazarus, who chains her up to keep her from seeking out men. The film explores themes of race, religion, music, and sex.",1
"'Mulholland Drive' is David Lynch's most successful expression of his unique style and vision, blending film noir, horror, surrealism, and parapsychology with postmodern self-consciousness and black humor. The film features wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring, whose lives intersect in a hallucinated Hollywood setting. The plot is difficult to explain and involves the discovery of a blue box and key that lead to a complete inversion of what the audience thought they knew. The film is a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip with stunning cinematography, evocative atmospherics, superb acting, and masterful directing/editing.",1
"The final film in the Aztec Mummy trilogy features Dr. Krupp, a mad scientist who wants to find the Aztec treasure buried in modern Mexico City. He creates a robot to defeat the Mummy, but the Mummy easily defeats both the robot and Dr. Krupp. The film is mostly made up of stock footage from previous films and the major star, Ramon Gay, was killed before filming.",0
"Anthony Wong stars in an excellent film that lives up to its title, featuring eroticism and increasing violence due to dreams purchased from a crazed occultist. The sorcerer manipulates Mr. Wong, leading to nightmares of great magnitude. The film is well-filmed, fast-paced, and includes serious magic, herbal medicines, power, corruption, sex scenes, and bloody violence. There are also occasional touches of humor, making for an exhilarating 90 minutes. The performances are excellent.",1
"Fans of Twin Peaks and HP Lovecraft will appreciate this film's eerie and familiar horror. It's not a traditional Western horror, but more like a Grimm's fairy tale. It's gory and for mature audiences, but captivating and memorable.",1
"I saw a pre-screening of this movie through UCLA and it was incredibly good. It made me laugh and I talked about it a lot afterwards. I now have a strong admiration for Tenacious D and will buy their album. It's worth the expensive ticket price for the comedy and amazing music. The storyline ties in well with the traditional ""D"" history and there are great cameos. It's one of the best movies, so go see it.",1
"Despite its visual beauty and good music, this film has a predictable and clichéd made-for-TV feel. The romance between the two main characters, who come from different backgrounds, is not believable. The movie follows a predictable plot, which is disappointing given its potential. It may be worth watching for free on cable, but it is not worth paying for. The soundtrack is the only redeeming quality.",0
"Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen, drawing inspiration from Rock Hudson's real-life dilemma of being a secretly homosexual screen idol. The film's retro production design is amusingly reminiscent of a Shag greeting card, but the dialogue is not very clever and the slapstick humor falls flat. However, the serious tone of the final act is handled with great taste and the pro-gay speech is a plea for tolerance. The movie lacks a clear agenda and the sentimental ending may come across as a prank to invested audiences.",0
"As a child 30 years ago, I watched a film that has stayed with me. I cannot judge its quality, but I was enamored with Jean Simmons and the erotic tone of the movie. I recall the plot and also had a similar experience with Simmons in David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS. Unfortunately, BLUE LAGOON is not on video, and I wish to revisit it to clarify my memories.",1
"The second Jackass movie is almost as good as the first, but with more disgusting skits. Fans of the first movie will enjoy it, but those who didn't like it will hate this one. Some scenes are classic, while others are disturbing. Despite mixed reviews, it's worth watching.",1
"This movie is one of my best possessions, and it took me years to acquire. It was intended to be anti-drug propaganda but ends up glorifying drug use. However, the consequences of drug use are eventually shown, delivering the intended anti-drug message. The soundtrack, featuring Pink Floyd, is excellent. It is a must-see movie.",1
"The animation and color in the film are great, with exaggerated teeth and mouths that make you laugh. The clever comedy throughout the film requires multiple viewings to catch all the gags. The film pokes fun at people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens. The only complaints are the portrayal of the cleric as an idiot and the overdone final action scene. Overall, it's an amusing film that will provide many laughs and can be enjoyed multiple times.",1
The movie that I enjoyed as a child is no longer entertaining to me as an adult. The jokes are now too childish and the plot is not believable. The villain is poorly portrayed and the final fight scenes are disappointing. I give it a 4 out of 10 rating.,0
"As a fan of this comedy, I have been waiting for its DVD release and got tired of waiting for it. I transferred my VHS copy to DVD and the quality is surprisingly good. I am offering to do the same for anyone interested for £7.00, which only covers my costs and postage. I am not looking to profit from it, just want to share this overlooked gem of a comedy. Payment details can be discussed through email.",1
"This movie is the worst I've ever seen. It misrepresents the Fantastic Four and should only be sold in comic book stores for desperate geeks. The cast's futures have been negatively impacted, except for Jay Underwood's performance. However, he is unlikely to get major roles unless he has a rare and interesting career spark.",0
"Although not personally entertained by Mr. Boorman's movies, the author finds Where the Heart Is to be a masterful satire and social commentary of its time. The author has had to replace their copy of the movie multiple times due to lending it out to others who appreciate its artistry. The author's favorite aspect of the movie is the paintings by Timna Woollard, which they have been searching for 15 years to acquire. They are looking for any information on where to find Timna's work or her studio in England.",1
"This is the uncut musical Alice, with a large cast enjoying themselves. Although there are a few off moments, it is amusing, tuneful, and just sexy enough. Kristine DeBell gives a fine performance in the lead role. There may even be an uncredited appearance by Richard Prior as the prone Knight.",1
"Chokher Bali is a film adaptation of Rabindranath Tagore's novel about a rebellious widow named Binodini who is denied marriage by two handsome men. She manipulates her way into the household of one of the men and fulfills her sexual desires, leading to a dramatic climax. The film explores themes of individual freedom and widow marriage, which was taboo at the time the story was written. The art direction and cinematography are praised for bringing early 20th century Bengal to life.",1
"I watched a snowboarding film before my holiday to get in the mood. The snowboarding scenes were impressive, but the story and comedy were poorly written and lacked depth. It may be worth watching for the snowboarding, but there are better films dedicated to the sport.",0
"Soul's Midnight is a fun and entertaining low budget vampire movie that incorporates St. George and the Dragon mythology in a unique way. Starring Armand Assante as the vampire leader, the movie could have benefited from a higher budget for better gore and effects. It's a good choice for fans of Gothic horror and vampire lore.",1
"The writer attended the Berlinale competition and saw a movie billed as a ""world premiere,"" but had difficulty getting into the film due to limited knowledge of the plot. The movie had a strange mix of light, dark, and supernatural elements, and the cuts and storytelling were abrupt and disruptive. The actors were good, but could not save the movie. The writer watched the movie with a technical eye and felt that it failed to draw them in. They expected more from a movie with such talented actors.",0
"The movie is depressing and asks more questions than it can answer, unlike the uplifting themes in the creator's previous works. The ending is not ""tacked on"" and follows logically from the premise, but there are flaws in the execution. The lead actor is excellent and the depiction of the Messiah's humanity and the modern world's reaction to the second coming are well done. The reviewer personally found the movie too bleak and prefers entertainment that is uplifting or distracting.",0
"This is an excellent film about four high school friends who come of age in the 1960s. Despite being apart for much of the decade, they manage to reunite and experience both tragedy and joy. It's a heartwarming story of life, love, and friendship that drama enthusiasts should not miss.",1
"Choosing the Devil as a subject can be terrifying because many people believe in its existence, providing a rich source of religious and mythological imagery. The episode is like a Hollywood blockbuster with impressive special effects and a minimal cast on a space station, creating a claustrophobic and intense atmosphere. The horror is intensified by the knowledge that the characters are stranded and being picked off one by one by the sinister Ood. This episode is emotionally engaging, frightening, and humorous without being cheesy, but it may not be suitable for children.",1
"As a 10-year-old, I attended Wrestlemania VI in Toronto, and the event I saw was different from what I recently watched on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD. It's unclear why the WWE doesn't have the rights to some of the old music, which is created by the WWF, and it's frustrating that they have to edit the videos so drastically. Hearing Demolition's theme music at Wrestlemania was a memorable experience that didn't exist on the DVD. It's pointless for the WWE to own the rights to a vast video library if they can't use it without significant changes.",0
"Despite being a 16-year-old male who finds the story a bit too feminine, I enjoyed the movie and found the actresses, including Alana, Adrianne, Deena, Kimberly, and Rachel, to be attractive and talented. Although I am not a fan of pop music, I thought Aaron Carter did a great job and seemed invested in the film. My mother, who grew up with older films, also enjoyed it. I would consider seeing a sequel and may even purchase the DVD. The movie is suitable for all ages, and I would even take a date to see it. It has something for everyone, including girls who can dream about Aaron Carter and guys like me who can admire the attractive female cast.",1
"Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth reunite in a lackluster romantic musical set in modern-day 1942 Buenos Aires, where Astaire's character impersonates a letter-writing admirer to Hayworth's society beauty. While their dancing is comfortable, Hayworth's performance is stiff and unremarkable, and the Jerome Kern score is forgettable.",0
"Despite being just a filler for me, I found this movie to be really great. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in two days and appreciated the well-cast main characters and their true friendship. The plot, which I initially thought would be corny, turned out to be true and the ending was satisfying. The movie successfully made me hate the bad guys and like the good guys, which is what a movie should do.",1
"The sequel to Atlantis is terrible and feels like three mediocre Disney cartoon episodes put together. The story, characters, and animation are all bad and unwatchable. The plot is ridiculous and pointless, and the characters lack personality. The picture quality is poor, and it's a waste of time and money. The original movie was much better, and Milo's return is disappointing.",0
"The film Latter Days is a powerful portrayal of the struggles and disrespect faced by the gay community. It delves deeply into the emotions of the characters and shows compassion for the gay community. The film is an eye-opener to the anti-homosexual sentiment in the world, even in schools where the term ""gay"" is used as an insult. It is time for the homosexual community to be proud of who they are. More films like this should be made and not just labeled as ""gay"" but as love stories. Gay directors should tell their stories from their perspective.",1
"Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance in the film ""Radio"" was outstanding and deserving of an Oscar. The movie may have some flaws, but Gooding's portrayal was the highlight. The scene where he learns of his mother's death was particularly emotional. The film's themes of mistreatment and tragedy were relatable to the reviewer's own experiences. The inclusion of the real-life Radio and coach at the end was a special touch. ""Radio"" is a must-see movie that will move viewers to tears.",1
"Despite the attractive girls and scenery, the movie is not accurate. The flight from São Paulo to Rio on a 747 is impossible, as smaller planes are used for the short distance. The route from the airport to home is also shown inaccurately. The topless girls are not a local habit, and only a few secluded beaches allow it. The indoor decoration is unrealistic, but the movie is entertaining and Demi Moore is excellent.",0
"William H. Macy consistently delivers strong performances and is a model for other actors. ""A Slight Case of Murder,"" directed by Steven Schachter, is a rare example of a well-made TV movie that tells a small but not simplistic story. It is enjoyable and highly recommended, with a rating of 7.6 out of 10.",1
"After re-watching a thriller that was once considered one of Hitchcock's weaker films, the speaker now finds it amazing and highly recommends it. The film's attention to detail creates suspense, and the final scene on the merry-go-round is breathtaking.",1
"The movie has stiff, unnatural performances, stereotypical characters and locations, and a terrible script. There is nothing original or interesting about it. Fans of Josh Hartnett, Chris Klein, and LeeLee Sobieski should enjoy their fame while it lasts because it won't be for much longer.",0
"This is one of the Coen brothers' better films, with an interesting and hilarious story and great characters. It may not be for everyone, but fans of the Coen brothers' films and those who enjoyed the trailer will likely enjoy it.",1
"The $6 two-video set was a mistake, despite reading reviews beforehand. The film is a three-hour patchwork of film, video, and stock footage, covering one chapter of Michener's novel. The actors did well despite a bad script, but should not have accepted the roles. Maria Conchita Alonso is only in one scene on the second tape, despite being top-billed.",0
"Years ago, I was impressed by a film at a festival and searched for it but found nothing available on DVD, Blu-ray, or in cinemas. The direction, story, music, and James Franco's performance were all excellent. This masterpiece deserves to be released and given another chance for people to see.",1
"The film depicts a man who skis down Mount Everest with the help of a large crew, resulting in the loss of a life and an anticlimactic ending. Despite the stunning shots captured by the film crew, the narrator deems the film meretricious and not worth watching.",0
"This show is a modern version of Candid Camera, featuring a Gen X or Gen Y person wearing fake teeth, hats, wigs, and glasses to set up people in strange situations. However, the jokes are often uninteresting and go on for too long, making the show tedious. The humor is geared towards younger audiences who enjoy shows like JACKASS. Fortunately, the show did not last long.",0
"Despite misleading marketing, this 1979 film is well-acted, beautifully shot, and features impressive special effects. It offers a unique take on the Dr. Moreau story and is one of the better versions filmed. The first fifteen minutes are particularly shocking, but the film remains strong throughout and is recommended for fans of dramatic costume/horror classics and gore-fests.",1
"The combination of Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro in a comedy leads to disappointment as their movie lacks logic and features a fantasy super-gun. The movie is not intended for adults or children, but rather for those in between.",0
"Despite some disrespect in the movie, Bruce Willis learns the value of respecting others from The Kid. This film offers refreshing lessons and is one of Disney's best, with minimal swearing and sexual innuendos.",1
Kokoda is a fictional movie set during WW2 inspired by events on the Kokoda track. The film is filled with cliché scenes from other war films and lacks evidence of the horrific conflict portrayed. Both sides fought hard for control of the track and suffered from logistic shortages. The film is a shallow disappointment and highlights the youth of the production team.,0
"This adaptation of 'The Hollow' is faithful and true, with excellent characterisation by the actors. Sarah Miles is particularly perfect as Lucy Angkatell, conveying both her lovable and unlikable qualities. The script follows the story closely, but the relationship between Midge and Edward feels sudden and may have been cut. Overall, the film is beautiful and worth watching.",1
"A friend recommended a film as very funny, but it turned out to be the worst film the person had ever seen, and they advise against watching it.",0
"The 'indie' filmmakers were copying David Lynch before Pulp Fiction. Delusion, a film with Kyle Secor, was a disappointment due to cliches and poor acting. The desert is a common location for indies to save money on lighting. It is not recommended to watch Delusion, but instead to watch Homicide or Wild At Heart. The title is wasted on the film.",0
"The definition of an intellectual is someone who can listen to ""The William Tell Overture"" without thinking of the Lone Ranger. The Lone Ranger became a part of American folklore through radio plays, movies, and TV shows. The TV adaptation was successful due to the use of existing radio dramas and the casting of Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels. The show featured a mix of veteran and up-and-coming actors and promoted fair-play, justice, and peace in the Wild West. The last seasons brought changes such as color filming and new music. The Lone Ranger character has become a permanent part of American identity.",1
"Having watched many horror movies, I can confidently say that this one from Full Moon Pictures stands out. Despite the typical cheesiness of vampire films, this one has a unique and interesting premise, as well as two good sequels. It's a must-see for fans of the genre.",1
"The film ""The Knowledge"" appealed to the writer due to their past experiences of driving around North London to avoid traffic and their interest in London in the late 70s. The film exceeded their expectations and portrayed a grimy and tatty London. Nigel Hawthorne's acting as The Vampire was brilliant, with unpredictable behavior and surreal mind games. Overall, the film was an enjoyable trip back in time and even those not interested in London in 1979 would enjoy the witty dialogue and likable characters.",1
"Lou Costello's last film is slightly better than his last movie with Abbott & Costello, but still a career misfire. Dorothy Provine's presence makes it somewhat bearable. Lou Costello cannot be blamed as a major studio released it. The magic was gone in their last few movies, including ""Dance With Me Henry"", which is painful to watch.",0
"The film had excellent photography and audio, particularly in its use of warm and cold colors in single sequences. However, the screenplay was poor and Jennifer Lopez's role seemed irrelevant to the plot. Despite this, the movie showcased the director's background and talent, which seems to be a trend among Indian filmmakers.",1
"'Oppenheimer' is an excellent docudrama with great acting, accurate historical representation, and captivating plot and dialogue. The only drawback is some actors' lack of convincing American accents. It is consistent with Richard Rhodes' history of the atomic bomb and compares favorably to the shorter 'Fat Man & Little Boy' film. The mini-series was unfortunately only shown a few times on PBS in the 1980s.",1
"The Japanese ghost girl movie is unoriginal and not scary, with repetitive scenes and lackluster drama. It may appeal to teenagers who listen to Japanese rock, but overall it is not worth watching.",0
"This adaptation of Mansfield Park is only suitable for teenagers who have never read Austen. It is a disjointed and inaccurate version of the book, with distracting inaccuracies in the cast's appearance. The only redeeming quality is Haley Atwell's portrayal of Mary Crawford. Overall, this production is a disappointment for Austen fans, with the exception of the version featuring Sylvestra La Touzel.",0
"Bedrooms and Hallways offers a glimpse into the mind of a man who believes he has discovered his true self, but realizes he may have made a mistake. This unique gay comedy is worth watching for its amusing one-liners, unusual scenarios, and eccentric personalities, even though it lacks a clear conclusion.",1
The story follows a soldier who is transported to a desert town and recounts how he became separated from his unit while fighting in Egypt. He befriended a leopard and became almost feral before eventually leaving the animal. The film is well-written and portrayed with beautiful scenery from Jordan and Utah.,1
"I really enjoyed this film because of its poignant and diverse scenes, authentic acting, clever dialogue, and sincere portrayal of the search for fulfillment in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships. The film addresses the paradox of both sexual orientations without resorting to caricature. Ultimately, if you are open-minded, the gender of those in a relationship won't matter. The performance by ""Mr. Smith"" from The Matrix as a gay real estate agent with unconventional desires is just one of the many impressive aspects of the film. Enjoy!",1
"The writer initially enjoyed watching the show but eventually found it to be plagued with common issues found in ""bad"" anime. The plot revolves around Kagome, a high school student who travels back in time to feudal Japan and joins a group of companions on a journey to recover the pieces of a sacred jewel shard. The series has too many filler episodes and lacks a satisfying conclusion. The animation is above average, but reused cells are noticeable. The characters are well-developed, and the romances are captivating, but the humor and plot become repetitive. The show has a large following dominated by obsessed fan girls. The writer recommends checking out the first 30 episodes but not watching the whole series.",0
"Tycoon is not one of John Wayne's best films after Stagecoach, with a weak plot despite some good action scenes. The movie follows two men who dislike each other and struggle to work together while building a railroad for a multimillionaire who refuses to provide adequate funding. Wayne falls for the millionaire's daughter, leading to a shotgun wedding, but their petty disputes cause fatalities among Wayne's crew. The film is also known for the presence of Laraine Day's jealous husband, Leo Durocher, on set. Overall, it is not a strong effort from Wayne.",0
"Eric Bogosian's stage play is expertly directed in this film adaptation, featuring compelling characters and a successful transition from stage to screen. It is highly recommended for those interested in the art of adapting plays to film.",1
"Despite the filmmaker's well-known left-wing political views, they have created a nuanced and non-preachy film that will prompt viewers to reflect on their stance on capital punishment, regardless of whether they are for or against it. The film is flawless.",1
"""Choose Connor"" is an excellent film with a well-written script and impressive direction by 21-year-old Luke Eberl. The acting is believable and the theme is important, as the protagonist learns a difficult lesson about trust, politics, and the system. It was well-received at the 2007 Woodstock Film Festival and is recommended for anyone with a functioning brain.",1
"The re-make of ""Up In The Air"" is terrible and almost identical to the original. The singing in the original is great and the songs are surprisingly good for a ""B"" movie. The original is available on DVD and worth watching.",0
"The movie is unrealistic and preachy, lacking a positive solution for kids fighting against the system. The protagonist's solution and the way it is dealt with is unconvincing. It is not worth watching on TV.",0
"Jay Craven's film adaptation of Howard Frank Mosher's 'Where the rivers flow north' is a successful transition from literature to screen, with a superb cast including Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. The film effectively transports the viewer to early 20th century Vermont through its locations, angles, and sets, and the score by the Horseflies fits the mood and scenery perfectly. The story portrays the fiercely independent American pioneer spirit, embodied by the character of Noel Lord, who is both admirable and stubborn. The film is a vibrant look at a bygone era and a type of character that has all but vanished, struggling to live their lives in a harsh environment while being at peace with the world around them.",1
"I bought a video from a discount table at a video store, expecting a good cast in an award-winning British sex comedy. However, the actors in gay roles played games with memories of more worthy films, making this comedy a cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the public, and their reputations. The film's reference to Austen classics and use of well-known stars raises questions about its political statement and acceptance of on-screen roleplay affecting lifestyles. I do not support this film.",0
"I disliked the few episodes I watched of the show and question why Dan Schneider, who created great shows like Drake and Josh, made this one. I also question the Emmy nomination for this show, as Drake and Josh was better but not nominated. The creators should be ashamed and I hope the show gets canceled or affected by the pregnancy of a cast member.",0
"The film is poorly made with bad acting and clichéd themes about Tuscany, Italy, divorce, and midlife. The main actor struggles to portray the character's self-pity. The camera uses a yellow filter throughout the film, even in scenes set in Rome and the Amalfi coast. Despite being one of the worst movies ever, it may be worth watching.",0
"Anatomie is unoriginal and not scary, resembling American horror slashers. It is predictable, inconsistent, and includes irrelevant scenes such as sex scenes with pop music and topless women. It is not worth watching.",0
"The movie is a waste of time due to poor quality in picture, sound, and acting. It is not based on actual facts and contains inconsistencies, such as the use of 911 in 1957. The scary aspect is underwhelming, but the actor playing Gein did a good job portraying mental disturbances. Overall, the movie is not recommended.",0
"The show ""Gimme Shelter"" is not currently available on DVD, but its lasting impact is evident. It was a post-modern attempt at magical realism with symbolic scripts and interactive music. Despite its attempt to recapture innocence, it ultimately failed. However, a book is being written about the show and copies may be available upon request.",1
"Demi and Woody, a poor married couple, meet Robert Redford who offers them one million dollars for a night with Demi. The predictable plot affects their marriage, but everything turns out okay in the end. The film is poorly scripted, directed, and acted, with the only redeeming quality being Demi's appearance in a black dress. The reviewer suggests avoiding the film.",0
"ITV may not want to release the classic film Bostock's Cup because it would highlight the inferiority of their current series, Mike Bassett. Despite being the funniest film the author has ever seen, it seems that few people in their office have watched it. Given ITV's poor track record in producing comedy, one would expect them to seize the opportunity to repeat something genuinely funny. The author suggests that combining the film with a lucrative telephone competition might pique ITV's interest. The author urges ITV to do the right thing by repeating the film and releasing it on DVD for those who appreciate original, high-quality comedy/drama.",1
"The film subtly alludes to Kieslowski's Rouge through its overall red atmosphere, with many backgrounds featuring the color, such as the tea-room. It is also considered one of the best recent movies.",1
The film is the worst I have seen with no good features. It appears to have been made quickly with little effort put into it. The lead character's transformation is unrealistic and the plot is predictable and uninteresting. I left the cinema feeling cheated and cannot recommend it to anyone.,0
"The author has mixed feelings about Carné, believing that his inspiration may have faded earlier than other directors of his generation. The film is too long and the party scenes drag on, but Pascale Petit and Andrea Parisy give strong performances. Laurent Terzieff is excellent as an anarchist, while Jacques Charrier is mediocre.",1
"William H. Macy co-wrote the movie adaptation of Donald E. Westlake's novel ""A Travesty"", in which he stars as a man who tries to cover up an accidental death and gets in over his head. The movie has a complex plot with many twists and turns, and Macy's acting, including breaking the fourth wall, is a highlight. The movie has dark humor and is engaging enough to watch multiple times.",1
"The writer enjoyed the first Iron Eagle movie, as well as Top Gun, for their flying and music, but found the sequels lacking in acting and plot. They believe the popularity of Iron Eagle compared to Top Gun is due to the fame of Jason Gedrick. The writer also appreciated a brief appearance by Shawnee Smith. Overall, they rated the movie 7 out of 10.",1
"The movie is excellent, with Chucky being the funniest character and Jennifer Tilly adding to its greatness. Tiffany and Chucky were together before his death, and ten years later, Tiffany brings him back to life as a doll. The movie is both scary and funny, with a 10/10 rating.",1
The mini-series is excellent and captures the essence of the book. The cast is exceptional and it is recommended for those interested in the Civil War and its history.,1
The reviewer rented the movie after hearing good reviews but found it bizarre and unexplainable at times. They were entertained for the first 100 minutes but found the last 40 minutes to be even weirder and contradictory. They were unable to make sense of the movie and concluded that it was either a work of genius that they couldn't understand or just weird for the sake of being weird. They chose the latter and did not enjoy the movie.,0
"Dark Harvest 2 is a poorly made movie with high production values and a terrifyingly realistic scarecrow on the cover. The plot follows a man searching for his daughters in a corn maze, but the movie is not worth watching and the reviewer regrets spending money on it.",0
"Jerry narrates a story where Tom falls in love with a female cat and loses her to his rival, Butch. The cartoon is presented in Cinemascope and Tom and Jerry are best friends, which is unusual. The reviewer found the cartoon sad and would have preferred ""Puss gets the boot"" on the DVD instead. The experimental short can be found on disc 2 of Warner Brother's 2-DVD Spotlight Collection set. The reviewer gave it a C-.",0
"The CEO of a biotech firm leads a search and rescue mission for his daughter and employees after their plane crashes in the Pacific Northwest. However, the film suffers from poor editing and annoying dialogue, and the plot, while having potential, is marred by rip-off aspects and ridiculous exposition. The monster costume is decent, but the missteps in the film, such as choppy dialogue scenes and irrelevant comments, make it difficult to enjoy. Despite the potential, the film receives a score of 3 out of 10.",0
"The movie featuring Natalie Portman is the best I've seen in 2000, with a great storyline, cast, and soundtrack. I enjoyed it immensely and give it a perfect score.",1
"Buddy Manucci leads a secret police squad called the Seven-Ups who use unconventional tactics to catch criminals. Buddy's childhood friend Vito helps him with information, but is secretly using Buddy's notes to set up mob families for kidnappings. When one of the Seven-Ups is killed, Buddy becomes determined to catch the culprits. The film features a thrilling car chase through New York City and explores themes of betrayal and the toll of losing a friend. Roy Scheider delivers a strong performance as the lead actor.",1
"After their mother's death, three siblings face separation in foster care, but the eldest plans a risky escape to find their only living relative. Their journey through the desert in a beetle is fraught with danger and desperation, but the film's emphasis on the importance of family makes up for its flaws. Despite a forced and over-dramatic ending, the movie is highly recommended.",1
"Despite high hopes for the film due to the talented cast, it was a disappointment with no humor, poor acting, and a lack of effort in developing the love story. The hit-man character was also underwhelming. The film is not worth watching despite the big names involved.",0
"This TV show is terrible with predictable storylines, cheesy scenes, and bad acting from Chuck Norris. Although it can be entertaining at times, it is still better than reality TV.",0
"The movie is indecisive about its genre, with insufficient plot for a real movie and too much for a soft porno. It follows a good princess who inherits the kingdom over her evil sister and escapes to Earth, but the acting, dialog, and storyline are all ridiculous, and there is not enough skin to satisfy those who watch for that. It is not even enjoyable as a ""bad movie.""",0
"The ""Thriller"" video is unparalleled and timeless, despite personal opinions of Michael Jackson. It scared the writer as a child, but now they appreciate its uniqueness and recommend everyone watch it.",1
"The writers are attempting to recreate ""Scrubs"" characters in a different profession, but the characters lack charisma and acting ability. The writing is poor and the humor targets a low IQ audience. The show's only saving grace is two attractive teachers. The show is struggling to follow the success of ""Scrubs"" and may lead viewers to lose hope in new sitcoms. The writer suggests the creators should stop before further humiliation.",0
"Director Mark Lester, known for his successful B action films, disappoints with this 1996 movie. Despite the talented Theresa Russell's performance, the illogical and unrealistic action scenes and lack of historical accuracy make it a pathetic film. The performances range from grade B to grade school, and it's best suited for a 4:00 a.m. Sunday slot on HBO.",0
"_The Wild Life_ is similar to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, but falls short. However, it is an enjoyable mindless movie with appearances from Scarface's little Latino and The Colonel. It has a Cameron Crowe feel and is rated no worse than a 6 in comparison to other genres and a 7 in terms of other 80s teen comedies. Only staniels gave it a 5.",1
"Despite having the same level of testosterone as others, the speaker finds Raquel Welch's acting to be poor and the movie lacking in substance. The cast is also disappointing, with unconvincing performances from Wagner, Cambridge, and de Sica. The film is a mess with a weak plot, unfunny script, and annoying music. However, Welch's appearance is a highlight and the only reason the speaker gave the movie a 3 out of 10.",0
"The film was terrible with no redeeming qualities. The racing scenes were laughably bad and the plot was forgettable. It was partially filmed at Spa-Francorchamps during the 1988 Grand Prix, but the reviewer is glad they didn't appear in any of the scenes. It had potential but ultimately fell short.",0
"The script, characters, plot, direction, jokes, and shoot out scenes in the movie are all poorly executed. Baldwin's portrayal of the hero is unconvincing and his power struggles with women are uninteresting. The conductor is incompetent and there are inconsistencies in the story, such as a hooded man with guns suddenly appearing and then disappearing. The ""happening"" in the movie may have been mistaken for a performance on a New York subway train.",0
"The trio evokes a nostalgic journey to the early stages of desire, before the complexities of adulthood. The adolescent angst portrayed in all three stories is genuine and rare in films. Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are now available on DVD as of September 1999.",1
"I was excited to see Juliette Lewis in the movie, but the script was initially complicated. As the movie progressed, it became clearer, but I was disappointed with the excessive use of sex. The well-prepared script was not executed well, and the ending was mediocre. The main character's message about having a baby was a disaster. The cast acted well, but it was not enough to save the movie.",0
"This movie is one of the worst I've seen, worse than its predecessor ""The Beginning"". The CGI hyenas were fake and real animals should have been used instead. The only positive aspects were the cinematography and costumes. It was a disappointment and a waste of money. I could do better with a multi-million dollar budget.",0
"The movie features a heroine whose Venus flytrap kills men who force themselves on her. The acting is subpar, but with better direction, the lead actress could improve. The male lead is unlikable. The film includes Siamese twins, a hot dog joke, nudity, low production values, poor scripting, bad acting, and mediocre camera work. The concept of the vagina dentata could have been interesting, but the movie fails to deliver. It's only worth watching while high, but there are better options available.",0
"Pigeon and Coburn are good, but Coburn is dull. The film is enjoyable for the scenery and fashion, but the dialogue and acting are bad. The plot is unoriginal and the build-up is pointless. It's better to watch other crime movies like Bedtime Story, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Sting, and House of Games.",0
"I enjoyed the first film and took friends to see it without checking. I regretted hyping it up to them. Disney ruined the original film and the dark-skinned FBI character downplayed the informant's fingerprinting results. It's okay as a standalone film, but terrible compared to the book or first film.",0
"The creator of Donnie Darko presents a film about a couple who receive a mysterious box with a red button that, if pressed, will result in a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. The film is suspenseful and thought-provoking, with good performances and intriguing subject matter. It contains plot twists and symbolism, and is shot well with an appropriately aged look. It's worth watching and will inspire discussion.",1
"The movie Blade Master tries to imitate the Conan films but fails due to its lack of coherence and poor acting by Miles O'Keefe. The film was originally Cave Dwellers, which was re-released with credits from the Sandy Frank stitching job.",0
"This is the sole Pauly Shore film worth watching, as it is both humorous and well-balanced, with Shore's usual antics not overshadowing the other actors. However, it is not particularly memorable.",1
"I watched a disappointing comedy movie this morning on DVD. Despite the creators' intention to make it funny, I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio was serious about it. The dialogue, acting, and story were all poor, and Ryan Phillippe's performance was his worst. Jason Statham lacked the skills to develop his imaginary role. I give it a 3/10 rating.",0
"Despite being in the minority, I found ""Radio"" to be filled with cliches and lacking in explanation for the characters' love for the titular character. The predictable moments failed to evoke emotion, and I wished I was watching ""Rudy"" instead. The cast gave good performances, but deserved a better movie.",0
"Initially intrigued by the premise and setting, I watched the first two episodes with an open mind but dismissed it as a half-season show. Recently saw an ad for it and was surprised it's still on. The characters are ridiculous and laughable, and I hope people are watching it for a laugh and not taking it seriously. It's generating ratings, but I hope no one is watching it seriously.",0
"The film had potential due to its subject matter, the excesses of the Catholic Church during the counter-reformation, but it failed to develop the topic and left many things unexplained. The lack of explanation made it confusing for American audiences. Additionally, the inaccurate portrayal of history focused on instruments of torture, bloody executions, and other sensational elements, making it more like a sword and sorcery movie with period costumes.",0
"The movie, directed and written by Eddie Murphy, is a disappointment. It follows a clichéd gangster plot and lacks originality. The actors are not given much room to shine, and even Murphy seems to be on autopilot. The production values are the only redeeming aspect, with the '30s setting feeling authentic. However, the dialogue and comedy fall flat, and the film fails to breathe new life into the exhausted nightclub genre. Murphy's direction is slow and lacks suspense, and the film ultimately falls short of its potential.",0
"The movie's effects were terrible, with half of it filmed on a stage with a fake background and poor CGI. The creator's lack of skill is evident, making the movie look like it was made in 1983. The story is also twisted, so it's recommended to skip it.",0
"Conrad's verbose prose cannot be adapted to a movie, resulting in a lack of the description and reflection that make the novel captivating. However, the movie is of good standard and has enhanced the plot with thoughtfully inserted references to Ancient Egypt. It is recommended to read the book instead.",1
"This is a highly enjoyable film adaptation of Rona Jaffe's popular novel about the lives and loves of women in the New York publishing industry. Directed by Jean Negulesco, it features talented actresses such as Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Suzy Parker, and Martha Hyer, as well as a standout performance by Joan Crawford as a ruthless editor. The male cast includes Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan, Robert Evans, and Brian Aherne. While the film is full of melodrama, it is a guilty pleasure for fans of shows like ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Sex and the City.""",1
"When I watch a bad movie like Lonesome Jim, I read IMDb comments to see if others agree with me. The characters and situations in the film were unbelievable and the ending was cliché. At first, I feel isolated when I see positive reviews, but eventually find like-minded critics who share my opinion. It's a relief to know that the movie was truly terrible and not just my own perception.",0
"Men who unironically refer to themselves as having ""game"" or being a ""player"" or ""baller"" are on a swift path to becoming a real-life version of ""A Night at the Roxbury"". Using the term ""The V.I.P."" instantly puts it in the Douchebag Dictionary, especially for white people. People who make TV shows based on uncool things and insult their potential audience are also on the list. Canadian Hip-Hop/R&B sensation Massari is included for his uncool and douchebaggy brand. ""Keys to the V.I.P."" is the ultimate offender for all of the above reasons.",0
"The movie was terrible and not worth discussing. The storyline was unintelligible, the characters were irritating, and the main character was particularly unbearable. It was the worst movie the speaker had ever seen and they wished for the main character's demise.",0
This is the worst movie I've ever seen. There's nothing positive to say about it. It's not even up to the standard of a low budget porn movie. Why did someone make a movie out of this script? I didn't even care if the main character survived. Don't watch it unless you want to waste 85 minutes of your life.,0
"This movie is indescribably bad and should only be watched as a form of torture. Even if you watch it on mute, the poor camera work and special effects make it a horror. Sandra Bullock has less than ten minutes of screen time and her acting is terrible. The rest of the cast is equally bad and could be replaced by baboons.",0
"The BBC's drama ""The Street"" was poorly acted, predictable, unrealistic, and insensitive, and did not compare to HBO's masterful productions such as The Wire, Sopranos, and Carnivale. The show lacked brutal violence and failed to portray the character's insanity and lack of remorse. The reviewer wishes they could express their disdain more eloquently, but the show was simply rubbish and did not provide any real perspective on life. The show received a rating of 1/5 stars.",0
"Leon Shamroy's CinemaScope color cinematography is impressive, with his use of colored filters. The Alfred Newmann Score is sensual and seductive, but unfortunately not available on CD. The acting is inconsistent, with varying accents and styles, but Ustinov's performance as a conniving servant stands out. The film's premise and themes are interesting, but the music and visuals are the most memorable aspects.",0
"Despite being panned by critics, the film about four potato delivery men with sexual problems fails to deliver any laughs or eroticism. The jokes range from tasteless to unbelievable, with blame falling on the writers. While the actors' performances were not great, they were not terrible either. The film may appeal to those with morbid curiosity or who enjoy watching bad movies with friends and alcohol.",0
"""Man of the Year"" is a political satire starring comedian Robin Williams, who is forced into running for office after criticizing political campaigns and presidents. He surprisingly wins and makes a mockery of the office. While not the funniest or best movie, it works in small doses and showcases the chemistry between Williams and director Levinson. It is recommended for those who enjoy satire and comedy, but not for those who prefer movies like ""Scary Movie 4.""",1
"The writer and their friends enjoyed the movie when it first came out on VHS, but upon reflection, they realized it was not very good. It lacks the charm of typical Mst3k fodder, but it is not unwatchable. The writer would watch it again if they were bored and drinking beer. The director's comments on the movie and their excessive use of caps lock are questioned.",0
"This mini series is highly praised and spiritually uplifting. It is a tender romantic drama with beautiful performances, sets, costumes, music, and scenes that make it stand out among other mini series. The difficulties of living as a lesbian in Britain in the 1890s are not a major issue, as only male homosexuality was illegal. It is considered essential television and one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas since Romeo and Juliet. A perfect score of 10 out of 10 is given.",1
"During a film festival in the 80s, upscale directors decided to create a movie where each of them would create a segment around a world-class aria. The movie features some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, including Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma. While not every director succeeded, the movie improves with each viewing and features an eerily beautiful love duet from Die Todt Statd. The movie is worth watching, especially if you're in a hyper-romantic mood.",1
"As big fans of Asian movies, my brother and I bought a promising-looking film we found in a shop. While the first scene was impressive, the movie turned out to be more of a love story than an action film, with clichéd and over-the-top romance. The characters were poorly acted and the movie never improved, earning it a spot on our ""worst movies ever seen"" list.",0
"The DVD cover was good enough to make me buy this terrible movie, but I want my money back. It's worse than anything I've ever seen and I can't even recommend it as a joke. The amateurish DVD authoring suggests it was self-distributed. The producers have no talent and should get out of the business.",0
"Footprints is a well-crafted psychological thriller with a powerful plot and suspenseful atmosphere. The director, Luigi Bazzoni, is underrated but visually impressive. Florinda Bolkan delivers an excellent performance as a dark and lonely character, and the rest of the cast is also noteworthy. The movie's cinematography, score, and story are all well-done and create a haunting and intense experience. The author wishes that more movies like Footprints were made today and hopes for a remastered DVD release.",1
"I had to use a different number because there was no 0 option in the vote. It's disappointing that movies with famous actors can have poor acting and writing. This movie is not comparable to Hitch and features Salman Khan's typical shirtless scenes and Govinda's unfunny laughs. If someone had told me 20 years ago that I would be commenting on Salman's work, I wouldn't have believed them.",0
"The film depicts the horror of rendition with a global cast, showing the blindness of those involved in the worldwide game of piling hatred and misery on their enemies. The interplay between a sympathetic Senator's Aide and Washington power-mongers is electrifying, while a new CIA man goes through a sea change in his attitude towards torture. The film is a wake-up call to those with decency left in them, showing how low the UK and USA are prepared to go in the name of freedom. The message is that those who condone torture and abuse of human rights are as wrong-headed as the Jihadists and suicide bombers. The film has a clever and thought-provoking surprise ending. The negative reviews may come from those who see the world through the simple specs of Hollywood.",1
"The second Lone Ranger movie is not as good as the 1956 classic, but still has plenty of action and a fast pace. The plot involves the Ranger investigating a series of murders of peaceful Indians by a gang of hooded killers. The film contains more violence than usual for a Lone Ranger adventure and has some racially insensitive comments. The Ranger uses disguises to solve the case and bring the outlaws to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels star in a visually appealing movie set in old Tucson. The music score is decent, but the traditional William Tell Overture theme is replaced by less impressive vocals.",1
"Al Adamson's films are not classic cinema and are instead trashy, sleazy, and cheesy. However, they have unintentional entertainment value and should not be taken at face value. Nurse Sherri is a story about a cult leader who dies and invades the body of a nurse, causing her to develop a taste for blood and sharp objects. It may be enjoyable for cult film fans but not for those who prefer mainstream movies.",1
"My friends and I enjoy watching bad movies for laughs, so we rented Camp Blood. It was shot on a camcorder and was so bad that we returned it and demanded a refund. We suggested that the store implement quality control to avoid stocking such terrible movies. Don't make the same mistake as me and watch it out of curiosity - it's not even funny.",0
"Morrissey's film, featuring Dallesandro, uses a flash-blip editing style to create a hypnotic, druggy mood. The film explores the complexities of sex and sex for sale, revealing the beauty of the male body and the difficulties of understanding human beings. The interactions between Dallesandro and his clients offer profound insights into gay-straight relationships. The film is inclusive and sympathetic, attempting to help us understand without dictating what we should understand.",1
"""Fat Man and Little Boy"" is a realistic portrayal of the events surrounding the Manhattan Project, with Paul Newman delivering a brilliant performance. However, the film tends to drag and some scenes could have been eliminated without affecting the overall story. Despite this, the film is accurate and fascinating, leaving the audience with something to ponder.",1
"""Tipping the Velvet"" is a BBC television film directed by Geoffrey Sax, following the coming-of-age story of protagonist Nan Astley, played by Rachael Stirling. Nan's life changes when she meets Kitty Butler, a male impersonator who she is sexually attracted to. The film depicts Nan's struggles as a lesbian and male impersonator in Victorian England, with excellent performances from the entire cast. The film highlights the difficulties faced by those who do not fit society's norms, particularly in regards to love and happiness.",1
"Quai des Orfevres starts slowly, but once the story begins, it is Clouzot at his best. The film features a world-weary pianist who plans to kill a studio mogul with designs on his wife, only to find that someone has beaten him to it. The police inspector is a wonderful creation, and the police station is a realistic and chaotic setting. The supporting cast compensates for the unconvincing femme fatale, with Simone Renant standing out as the lesbian photographer. The film has great black and white photography and a nice twist ending. The Criterion DVD includes interviews with Clouzot, Blier, and Renant.",1
"This is an excellent crime thriller featuring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, directed by Johnny To and with music by Arthur Wong. The film is visually stunning and the music cues are exceptional. The performances by Lau Ching Wan and Andy Lau are strong and dynamic. The only flaw is some poor English dubbing in one scene with Waise Lee.",1
"This movie depicts a middle class family's attempt to understand the late 1960s America, but their journey to a rock festival is as far as they get. The characters are shallow stereotypes and the well-known actors in the credits were likely desperate for work. The writers had little understanding of the hippie movement beyond drug use.",0
"The movie is a bit cheesy but still suspenseful and entertaining. The actors, including David Soul, Robert Conrad, and Sam Waterston, do a good job despite the limitations of the plot and characters. The poor quality of the VHS tape makes it difficult to fully enjoy, but the author believes there would be a market for a DVD version.",1
"""Witching Time"" is the first episode of the British horror anthology series ""Hammer House of Horror."" It follows a stressed musician named David Winter who discovers a mysterious woman claiming to be a witch in his barn. Despite his skepticism, he locks her in a room, but strange and disturbing events begin to occur to him and his wife. The episode is a well-structured and entertaining horror-themed TV show with good characters and dialogue, although it has a lower budget and less exploitation than Hammer's feature films. Overall, it is a good start to the series and a well-made piece of British TV.",1
"I loved the movie, but was disturbed by the connection between the two best friends, Tim and Kyle. The writer gave us a poignant moment of their sexual experimentation/confusion, but then revealed they were half brothers, which was in bad taste and left unexplained. Despite this, it was a spectacular film.",1
"The movie Mamma Mia is a terrible experience, with everything about it being wrong. Its success is unexplainable, and even the presence of great actress Meryl Streep does not save it. The singing and dancing are ridiculous, and the mistakes in the movie are endless. Despite this, the author suggests watching it to truly understand its awfulness.",0
"I worked at a video store and took home a horror movie as a free rental. The movie was terrible and destroyed a respected sub-genre of film. It had a low budget and mostly took place indoors at night. The plot was absurd and included soft core female nudity. The bad acting, dialogue, and plot turns made it a very bad film.",0
"""Blame it on Rio"" is an 80's romantic comedy about two middle-aged men on vacation in Rio de Janeiro with their daughters. The plot involves one man getting involved with the other's daughter, but the attempt at handling the moral issue seriously falls short. Michelle Johnson's performance as the temptress Jennifer is awful and ruins the film.",0
"A screenwriting instructor and former MGM screenwriter stumbled upon a charming film featuring Betty White on Channel 33 in Dallas. The film made them long for the days of good movies before Hollywood began producing content for teenagers. They believe there is a market for movies without guns, killing, special effects, sex, and violence, but with touching human relationships that leave viewers with warm feelings.",1
"The Curse of Monkey Island is a classic game with great humor that people of all ages can enjoy, despite the declining popularity of graphic adventures. Its sequel, Escape from Monkey Island, is predicted to also become a classic.",1
"Despite being a great movie, there were numerous mistakes in the soccer scenes. It is unclear if the filmmakers had any knowledge of the sport, as there were several violations of FIFA rules, such as boys and girls not being allowed to play on the same team. The scoring of goals was also unrealistic, and the players seemed to lack knowledge of soccer. The training scenes focused solely on shooting, and the posters in the characters' room were all for players from one team. Overall, the movie was enjoyable, but the soccer scenes were unrealistic and should have been consulted with an expert.",1
"The movie ""Scarecrow Gone Wild"" received a four out of ten stars due to poor acting, plot holes, cheap special effects, and anti-climactic scenes. Despite these flaws, the movie was considered cinematic gold. The topless women, fake gore, and poor dialogue made it seem like it was written by a stereotypical teenage boy. The reviewer suggests that the movie could have been better if the scarecrow turned out to be the baseball coach portrayed by Ken Shamrock. The reviewer also questions how much the filmmaker paid the teenager who wrote the movie.",0
"This movie is excellent and deserves a 10/10 rating. It features a unique storyline where the main character is mute and the entire movie is a long stalking scene. The plot involves the character witnessing a murder and being chased, leading to a believable and intense experience with surprising twists and a great ending. It is highly recommended not to miss this movie.",1
"Crispin Glover's acting is impressive and believable, particularly in his portrayal of Layne. Dennis Hopper also delivers a strong performance as Feck. The film explores the theme of choosing between right and wrong without relying on logic, emphasizing the importance of friendship. Despite its serious tone, Rivers Edge is enjoyable to watch and has a nostalgic 80s feel. It is regrettable that the reviewer did not discover it sooner.",1
"Carlos Mencia has been accused of stealing jokes from other comedians, including Cosby and Kinison, and retelling them poorly. The writers of his show may also be to blame. However, not all of his material is stolen, and some of his original jokes are also terrible. He is popular among young audiences but may not have a lasting career.",0
"As a young person, I am discovering the classic Hammer horror films on DVD. However, the late entry in the Christopher Lee Dracula series lacks the magic and atmosphere of the original. Lee's character is one-dimensional and the young characters are uninteresting. The only highlight is Caroline Munro, but she exits the story too soon. Despite the presence of Lee and Peter Cushing, the film is empty and lifeless.",0
"It is unbelievable that someone created and produced this nonsensical show, which aired on television and had advertisers pay to be associated with it. The show is so repulsive that the author burned any Barney tapes given to their child and was unpleasantly surprised to find it in their library. The child actors are smarmy and their parents have no sense, leading the author to believe they will turn to drugs before their teenage years. The author had to add an extra line to the review to get it on IMDb.",0
"Despite high hopes from the DVD description, this movie was a disappointment and not worth the rental fee. It started slow and lacked entertainment value, with only occasional moments of humor. The comparison to American Pie was inaccurate and the brief nudity was also unsatisfying. Overall, the movie was a waste of time.",0
"The film has many gaps and jumps in time, making it difficult to follow. The cinematography is beautiful, but it does not make up for the flaws in the movie. The reviewer lost interest after an hour and a half and does not recommend watching it.",0
"Yahoo Serious' latest film is a disappointment and lacks substance. It is hoped that its lack of success will prevent him from obtaining funding for future projects. The film is considered one of the worst examples of Australian comedy, and it is unfortunate that Yahoo is given opportunities to showcase his immature humor when there are more talented comedians in Australia. Despite having seven years to develop the script, the film falls short of expectations.",0
This vampire hunter movie is more thrilling than the Wesley Snipes film and has superior characters. The protagonist must rescue Los Angeles from a vampire coven with the help of a tabloid journalist. It's enjoyable and the character names are fantastic.,1
"The Postman, starring Kevin Costner, is a predictable and sentimental post-apocalyptic movie about a wanderer who becomes a postman and leads a group of mail carriers against a band of warlords. The idea of using a mail system to unite isolated villages against the warlords is sensible, but the execution is lacking. The acting is decent, but the syrupy dialogue and overacting detract from the film. The score is competent but falls short of the epic standards the movie aims for. Overall, the movie is not worth watching.",0
"Hollywood's ""left wing"" is making lukewarm movies that neither condemn nor embrace the war on terror, which is ironic. The movie in question does not condemn war or question it, nor does it show patriotism or honor. The lead actor, Ryan Philippe, is not convincing in his role as a Texan soldier.",0
"I rented a movie thinking it was part of the Scarecrow Slayer series, but it turned out to be just as bad as I expected. The bad acting, poor filming, and terrible special effects made it worth watching. The special features were a disappointing look into the six months of filming. One memorable line was ""The sins of my forefathers! They've trickled down to this very moment of time!""",0
"The film follows Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends a year in Barcelona and undergoes personal growth. The story is relatable for those who have experienced an Erasmus semester, with accurate depictions of shared flats, relationships, and cultural differences. The film is trilingual and has subtitles. It is highly recommended for Erasmus students, but also enjoyable for others as a comedy.",1
"Mulholland Drive is a complex and multi-dimensional film that explores themes of betrayal and jealousy. Every frame is important and links to other parts, creating a puzzle for the viewer to piece together. The movie is highly original and showcases Lynch's mastery of film-making as an art form. The plot is difficult to understand, but Lynch's use of sound, perspective, chronology, and form creates a work of art that is dark and frightening, yet realistic. The characters and situations are incredibly realistic, and the movie is a journey through the subconscious. It is a truthful and naked movie with indisputable artistic value.",1
The movie is one of the worst from the Sci-Fi Channel. It portrays men as bloodthirsty monsters and assumes that all soldiers are male. The story is poorly written and insulting to the intellect. The acting is like that of a Lifetime movie. It is a waste of time and should be avoided. The rating is 1 out of 10.,0
"The documentary directed by Ted Demme and Richard LaGravenese explores the golden era of American cinema in the 1970s, highlighting the legacy of the illustrious people involved in making movies during that time. The film industry has since changed dramatically, with big studios prioritizing revenue over content and integrity. The importance of independent film spirit is emphasized by America's best creative minds, as it affords great moral and artistic rewards. This documentary is a must-see for movie fans.",1
"The Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà takes viewers on a journey through the autopsy room, providing a blow-by-blow account of the dissection process. The film's story is simple, following a troubled coroner who discharges his psychological tension in a non-traditional fashion. The film's artistic values are questionable, with actors who don't speak and limited camera work. The authenticity of the dissection is impressive, but only a handful of medical/forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct it is. The shock and disgust factor is high, making it unlikely that unsuspecting viewers would stumble upon the film. While Cerdà is a gifted director, this film is recommended only for medical students or specialists studying mental disorders and sexual deviations.",0
"Meryl Streep's talent as an actress may be taken for granted due to her consistent performances, but her work in ""One True Thing"" showcases her ability to create subtle and charming characters. Streep works from the inside out to find unique qualities for each character, which may be mistaken for aloofness or self-consciousness. Her performances are consistently impressive, and she brings depth to her characters, such as Kate Muldrun, who surprises the audience with unexpected emotions. Despite the mediocre script and unlikeable characters, Streep's intelligence, empathy, and expressive skills make her performances touching and believable.",1
"Despite the terrible acting and nonsensical plot, some viewers may find enjoyment in this low-budget film featuring mutated creatures caused by atomic bombs. However, the monster is poorly made and the lack of gore does not improve the overall quality. It is not recommended to watch.",0
"Initially, the author did not appreciate Jimmy Cagney's films due to their lack of realism and unsubtle acting. However, after watching more, they became hooked and now enjoy these aspects. The film ""The Mayor of Hell"" provides solid entertainment despite its far-fetched plot and offensive stereotypes. The cast, including Cagney, Dudley Digges, and Allen Jenkins, deliver exceptional performances. The Black actor Farina, known for his roles in Our Gang comedies, also gives a good performance despite being given an insipid name and stereotypical role.",1
"Paul Bettany's performance as a grieving father was commendable, but the movie focused too much on Darwin's incomplete stories and skipped over the disputes surrounding his theories. The soundtrack was overly sad and the trailer misrepresented the film. Without the trailer scenes, the movie would be a generic family drama about a child's death. Despite this, the acting was excellent.",1
"Lesley Selander directed an early 1950s Sci-Fi film with primitive but decent special effects. The movie features two leading men, a young scientist and a newspaper reporter, and a team of space experts who encounter friendly but deceptive Martians led by Ikron, who plans to conquer Earth. The film also includes a beautiful Martian who is the redeeming element of the story.",0
"Bill, an untidy man with writer's block, follows people around the streets for inspiration. He follows a well-dressed man named Cobb, who turns out to be a burglar. Cobb takes Bill with him to steal things and disrupt people's lives. The film uses flashbacks and puzzle pieces to tell the story. Bill cuts his hair and dresses in a suit on Cobb's advice and meets a dangerous bald man's ex-girlfriend. The puzzle pieces come together in a surprising conclusion.",1
"The movie is disgusting and filled with violence and sex. The story of a Roman emperor is just an excuse for gore and nudity. The only reason someone would like it is if they enjoy violence. The characters are all mad and the movie is dark, dull, and boring. It's not a movie, just 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex. It's better to watch a porn movie or horror flick if you want those things.",0
"The program aired on SPACE, a cable sci-fi station in an early morning time slot. It consists of short, amateurish scenes with no plot or continuity, featuring poor writing, sets, and special effects. The scenes are only a minute long and revolve around lame jokes or special effects. The program is an embarrassment and would work better as interstitials between shows instead of commercials.",0
"The ""Gastineau Girl"" complains about being associated with her famous football player husband and believes her reality TV show is the reason for her fame. However, she fails to provide a clear explanation of her job and the show is not a good example for anyone except those interested in materialism.",0
"Initially skeptical about the film due to his dislike of David Duchovney, the reviewer admits that Return To Me is a delightful and romantic film with a strong story and cast. Duchovney and Driver deliver powerful performances, and the supporting cast adds humor and heart to the story. The film explores themes of love, friendship, and family, and is recommended for those who enjoy a good romance and a good cry. The reviewer gives the film an 8.5 out of 10 and expresses a willingness to see anything directed by Bonnie Hunt.",1
The movie was poorly made and lacked depth in characters and story. The acting was subpar and the portrayal of famous musicians was ridiculous. It did not offer any new insights into the band's history and was a poor representation of music history.,0
"L'Appartement is a complex movie that requires full concentration and attention to detail. The first 3/4 of the film centers around the question of why Max and Lisa split, and it becomes clear that they were manipulated by Alice. The acting is great, and the storytelling technique gradually feeds the audience bits and pieces of the plot. The only downside is the somewhat unsatisfying ending, but it was necessary for symmetry.",1
"HBO's show Oz provides a realistic view of prison life, with a focus on the gangs that exist within. The show features 10 gangs, including the Muslims, Homeboys, Latinos, Sicilians, Irish, Bikers, Aryans, Others, Christians, and Gays. The Homeboys are the largest gang, while the Aryans are the most hated. The show is explicit and not for the faint of heart, featuring drug use, prison rape, murders, and gore. Augustus Hill's commentary helps viewers understand the issues involved with Oz. Despite its disturbing content, Oz is considered by some to be the most influential and greatest show ever created.",1
"A rocket experiment on cosmic rays causes a mutant space gorilla to kill teenagers in a Texas town. Despite enjoying low budget monster movies, the reviewer found Night Fright's terrible pacing and uninteresting scenes to be too boring to enjoy, even after three viewings.",0
"The author woke up to a beautiful day and wanted to watch a new horror movie. However, they found a terrible movie with bad acting and laughed at how bad it was. They do not recommend it and suggest throwing it out the window before watching. They also ask for recommendations for better corn-themed movies.",0
"Watching this type of film reminds me of classic English humor, like Monty Python and Man About The House. Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina give outstanding performances, and the rest of the cast is also impressive. The movie starts slow but becomes increasingly amusing, and I found myself laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. Overall, it's a hilarious English film that surpasses the supposed ""funny"" movies from Hollywood.",1
"If you enjoy terrible movies, Ghost Fever is a must-see. The two main characters and even the ghost break dance, and Sherman Hemsley sings the theme song. However, the writer warns that there are many jokes about male genitalia, which they find disturbing. Despite this, the writer recommends renting the movie and having a good laugh with friends.",0
"Barnens O is a strange movie with an unusual soundtrack by Jean Michel Jarre. It was sometimes boring, confusing, and had sexual references. The main character is obsessed with not growing up. It's not a must-watch movie.",0
"This movie is great despite its slow plot, bad special effects, ridiculous acting, and poorly choreographed action. It's hilarious, especially with the dubbed version, and will leave you wanting a sequel where the mummy fights wrestling women. I highly recommend it unless you only like high-quality films.",1
"The film's timeline consists of laughter, smirks, a yawn, checking the time, walking out, and remembering the funny parts at the beginning, but ultimately the movie fails to live up to its promising concept.",0
"This is an excellent film noir movie with all the classic elements such as bad guys, bad girls, a jewel heist, a twisted morality, and a kidnapping. The cast, led by Jean Servais, is full of talented character actors who know they are part of something special. Enjoy with popcorn!",1
"The movie is so bad that the author wishes they could give it a zero rating on imdb. It is one of only two movies they have ever walked out of and features big name actors. It is difficult to think of a worse movie, although Armageddon comes close.",0
"The movie is a poor quality Kung Fu film with a weak storyline, bad acting, and terrible dubbing. However, the fight scenes are somewhat impressive despite the absurd instigations and poor editing. Overall, the movie is not great but can be watched to pass time.",0
"Former students from Monte Alto International High School spend a night in the abandoned institution where they are killed off one by one by a killer called the watchman. The movie ""School Killer"" references teen slasher films like ""Scream"" and ""Friday the 13th"" and has a twist ending similar to ""The Sixth Sense"". The uncertainty about the killer's status provides mild interest, but the characters are one-dimensional and the constant walking through dark corridors is irritating. The presence of Paul Naschy and decent gore save the film slightly. Manuela Velasco from ""Rec"" has a small role. The movie receives a 4 out of 10 rating.",0
"This 80's horror film is a classic that features psychotic children who want to kill all the adults in town. The violence is both funny and gruesome, and the children use weapons like pistols, crossbows, and shovels. The movie also includes a character from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS and a little girl from the BLUES BROTHERS. Despite being possessed by extraterrestrial forces, the children are not like the Children of the Damned. The film also includes scenes of Julie Brown dancing in her bedroom and showing her breasts. It is a rare gem that the author wishes they had seen as a child and hopes for a sequel.",1
"The central themes of God, Satan, Good, and Evil have been explored in numerous works of art, music, literature, and film. However, End of Days fails to deliver a compelling story due to its two-dimensional characters and stereotypical plot. The only noteworthy scene is the beginning, where Gabriel Byrne's character undergoes a transformation and interacts with his partner in a modern take on vampirism and the seductive power of evil.",0
"The movie ""Chupacabra Terror"" receives a 2/10 rating due to the poor acting, unrealistic sets, and unconvincing monster killings. The Navy Seal team's appearance, wearing bicycle helmets painted black, adds to the bad movie baggage. The plot involves two men attempting to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra aboard a cruise ship, which ultimately gets loose. The cast is talentless and unattractive, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, who appears to have no reason for being in the film. The Chupacabra's green glow-in-the-dark blood is unrealistic, and the lack of nudity and poorly executed death scenes make the movie a disappointment.",0
"As a child, I adored a sweet and sensitive movie that I now want to share with my daughter. It is reminiscent of Disney classics like Pete's Dragon and Mary Poppins, with a mix of live action and animation. The film teaches children the importance of honesty and trust. It is a refreshing break from the violent and tasteless movies that are popular today, and I believe all children would enjoy its charming qualities.",1
"Most of the movie Airport '77 is made up of stock footage, with only a small part featuring new material that is bland and poorly acted. The director, Fred Olen Ray, uses fake names to keep working and the film lacks professionalism. It is a waste of money and time, and the crew are just hoping for a paycheck without being associated with the film. The director's commentary track reveals his true identity, but it's not worth watching the movie.",0
"Myrna Loy's performance as a gypsy girl is overacted and unrecognizable from her previous roles. The film is uninteresting and poorly executed, with the exception of its sound quality. It is considered a guilty pleasure by some, but is ultimately just a bad movie.",0
"This film is incredibly strange and has a bizarre script, direction, and casting. It's worth renting if you want to be amazed and surprised. Don't read any reviews and just watch it to experience it for yourself.",1
"In 1981, I wrote an essay called ""The Last American Virgin"" based on my experiences, and a friend named Nancy was the prostitute in the film adaptation. A year later, I saw the film's advertisement and realized it was taken from my essay. I didn't have any proof except for my English teacher who gave me an A. I never took any action and just told my closest friend. Nancy even asked me for story ideas after the film came out. It was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen.",0
"The film by Harmony Korine left the writer feeling disturbed and disgusted, despite raising important questions about life and God. The only positive aspect was the beautiful filming location. The writer does not recommend the film.",0
"The original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much is preferred by many reviewers, but the 1956 version is still a well-done film. Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day give strong performances, and the supporting actors are competent. The film includes classic Hitchcockian touches such as non-English dialogue, foreboding music, and a slow-moving assassin's gun. While not as deep as some of his other films, it is still considered one of Hitchcock's top five masterpieces.",1
"Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna is a two-part historical TV movie based on the book Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It is well-made and features notable actors such as Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom. However, some important details were skipped in Part 2, and it is now known that Anna Anderson was a fraud. The production values were impressive when it first aired in 1986, and it is unfortunate that similar quality TV movies are no longer being made.",1
"Leslie Nielsen explained on talk radio why there were only 6 episodes of Police Squad. The show relied heavily on sight gags, making it necessary to watch closely. The humor was not explained, leaving it up to the viewer to understand. Nielsen also noted that the movies had similar reliance on sight gags.",1
"""Beyond Rangoon"" is a highly emotional and intense film directed by John Boorman and starring Patricia Arquette. Despite its lack of commercial success, it is considered one of the best films of the 90s and is a must-see for its gripping story and unforgettable characters.",1
"This movie has some flaws in its portrayal of homosexuals, but it provides insight into the misconceptions surrounding AIDS. It showcases a heartwarming friendship between two boys and evokes both laughter and tears. The acting, particularly by Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro, is excellent. While the language is strong, it is appropriate, and the film is entertaining and intelligent for all ages. Be prepared with tissues.",1
"Although not a favorite Hitchcock film, it is still good, with Jimmy Stewart improving the material and a scary-looking assassin. Doris Day's performance was not enjoyable, and the film was too polished compared to the original, which was grittier and added to the scary ambiance.",1
"Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, and Julianne Moore deliver strong performances in the film about the porn industry. The drug use scenes were important but overdone. The director, Paul Thomas Anderson, was chosen based on his previous work. The family-like atmosphere between the characters is portrayed brilliantly. The soundtrack captures the disco era. The story follows Eddie Adams, who becomes an adult film star named Dirk Diggler, and his struggles with drug addiction. The film also explores subplots for other characters. Overall, a well-done film.",1
"Udo Kier received a small payment and free food for his role in the movie, which is a victory. The film follows a salvage crew who discover the Demeter, and includes Coolio playing a drug-loving character named 187. The vampire in the movie is not actually Dracula, and there is a theory that Dracula left the movie early, leaving his brother Orlock to play the vampire. The best part of the film is when 187 becomes a vampire and has a monologue about Erika Elaniak's body. Other events in the movie include Casper Van Dean's appearance, Orlock losing his arm, and the revelation that Erika's character is a police bot. The movie ends with the ship on a course to crash into the sun, and the surviving characters deciding to have sex and die. The movie is rated highly because of Coolio's performance, but it lacks nudity.",1
"The Sleeping Dictionary is a bad movie about an English colonialist who falls in love with a native Malaysian prostitute who teaches him her language. The film focuses more on the sleeping part than the dictionary part. Despite major flaws, the movie delivers on exotic location and a beautiful actress, Jessica Alba, who plays the sleeping dictionary. Alba is not a great actress and doesn't look Malaysian, but her beauty is rare and captivating.",0
"In 1997, the writer saw a great movie with a top-notch cast at a local cinema despite it being on a small screen. The movie kept the writer glued to their seat and they found no flaws in it. They highly recommend it to thriller lovers and give it a 10/10 rating.",1
"The author admits to not knowing much about Marquis de Sade and is surprised to learn he may have been homosexual. The movie based on his life is criticized for being thin and more of a parody, with a focus on showing a Parisian brothel and many breasts. The author notes that fans of John Rhys-Davies may be interested in seeing him in a different role as Inspector Marais.",0
"""Chips"" is a touching film that combines music, comedy, and drama, featuring outstanding performances by Peter O' Toole and Petula Clark. O' Toole portrays a reserved teacher who finds love and becomes a beloved headmaster with the help of Katherine (Clark). The songs in the film are emotional and thought-provoking, with O'Toole's final speech being a standout moment. The film is a beautiful portrayal of how love can change a person, and the importance of teaching kindness and respect.",1
"Despite my friend's recommendation, I regret watching this movie due to poor acting and strange costumes. The special effects were the only redeeming quality, but overall it was worse than Pearl Harbor and one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made.",0
"The film has one positive aspect, showcasing the changing music scene in NY during '81. However, it has three major flaws: unnecessary narration, unsynchronized audio, and a poor ending. It is not recommended unless one is a fan of the featured bands.",0
"A Cryptozoologist captures a chupacabra on a Caribbean island and bribes his way onto a luxury cruise ship, resulting in disastrous consequences. The monster looks like a guy in a rubber suit, but John Rhys-Davies delivers a good performance. The special effects are mediocre, but there are some funny lines and a sub plot involving a thief. The movie is not scary, but worth watching for fans of B monsters.",0
"The movie's main idea involves exploring past lives, but it's actually a journey within oneself and not related to the past or future. The music is repetitive and out of place, and the romantic scenes are unnecessary. The idea needed more development and better background settings. Overall, the movie is lacking.",0
"The movie is so bad that it caused physical and emotional reactions in a group of 18-year-old guys who watched it. The cameraman even trips and swears on camera. The movie warns viewers not to watch it, and the author suggests buying copies to send to people you hate.",0
"Cleopatra challenges Caesar to prove that Egyptians are better than Romans by building a castle in three months. She hires architect Numerobis and promises him gold if he succeeds and death by crocodile if he fails. Numerobis seeks help from Panoramix, Asterix, Obelix, and Ideiafix. The movie is funny, but the French language jokes may not be universally understood.",1
"The 1925 film Potemkin depicts the mutiny on a battleship in Odessa and celebrates the 1905 uprising as a precursor to the October Revolution. Eisenstein's montage theory is evident in the use of scene duration, camera angles, and illumination techniques to emphasize his message. The famous ""Odessa Steps"" sequence features a baby carriage coming loose after its mother is shot, later recreated in The Untouchables. The film is innovative and requires patience and a love of cinema to appreciate its 70-minute runtime.",1
"Despite criticism, I enjoyed Ocean's 12 as eye candy for both genders. Soderberg, known for artsy films, delivers a light, commercial movie. Zeta-Jones is stunning. The ending hints at a third installment, which I will eagerly watch.",1
"I was lucky to record and rediscover a great drama from Masterpiece Theatre. I transferred it to DVD and still love it, though I wish there was more of the character Kester. The lead actors are excellent, especially Prue who is strong and admirable despite the negative attitudes towards her affliction. I hope to own a professional DVD copy in the future.",1
"Despite its potential with talented actors and a promising director, ""The King Is Alive"" ultimately falls short due to a weak plot and reliance on sex as a crisis point. The cinematography is stunning, but the choice to use ""Lear"" as the play within the film does not work and the dialogue is lacking. While not the worst Danish dogme '95 movie, it fails in comparison to recent films like ""Italiensk for begyndere"" by Lone Scherfig. It is a bad film, but visually beautiful.",0
"Walter Matthau plays a philandering dentist who lies to his girlfriend Goldie Hawn, demonstrating the dangers of dishonesty. Goldie Hawn's character is deserving of her Oscar, and Ingrid Bergman's portrayal of a reserved nurse is also moving. This underrated movie is enjoyable to watch in any season.",1
"A man kills a bear and becomes a bear. He meets another bear but remains a man/bear. The movie lacks conflict and potential, and the use of two moose is irrelevant. It is underwhelming and needed more entertainment value, such as humor and drama. It is a bad film, receiving a ""D"" rating.",0
"I accidentally rented this film, mistaking it for another with the same title, and realizing I had rented it before. The plot involves a couple renting a haunted studio apartment in Los Angeles, with ghosts enhancing their sex life before becoming more menacing. The film is filled with cheap R-rated sex scenes and thrills, and is ultimately a waste of time.",0
"Although unoriginal, ""From Hell It Came"" trivializes the serious issue of fallout from atmospheric atomic tests, which was causing concern among scientists worldwide at the time.",0
"This movie is terrible and not worth watching. It is scientifically inaccurate, has cheesy special effects, weak direction, and does not do justice to Ray Bradbury's stories. Watching it may even turn you off movies altogether. Avoid it at all costs.",0
"Approach this movie with an open mind as it starts with black humor and takes you on a frightening journey through Moscow's dark centers. The mute character is mainly used as a plot tool, but the unexpected twists keep you engaged. The movie's setting in Russia adds to its impact and potential for future gangster movies. It's a beautiful and terrifying horror movie that evokes sympathy for the mute character. Avoid watching it late at night if you want to sleep well.",1
"SNAKES ON A TRAIN is a low-budget film with decent visual effects about a woman cursed with snakes inside her body who must seek help from a shaman in Texas before the snakes consume her. The snakes grow rapidly and attack the passengers on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. The film features no notable actors except for Julia ""Rayanne"" Ruiz and has a strong finale sequence. Alby Castro, Al Galvez, and Giovanni Bejarno also receive acting credit.",0
"The film had potential, but it was ruined by the casting of Amitabh Bachchan and the director's shameful adaptation of Lolita into a vulgar and predictable story. The character of Jia lacked the innocence and complexity of the original Lolita, and the chemistry between her and her friend Ritu was not believable. The portrayal of Bachchan's wife was underwritten and wooden, leaving viewers feeling irritated and helpless. The film is a train-wreck and should be watched at one's own risk.",0
"The movie Komodo vs. Python has a terrible title and premise, but still manages to be funny due to its bad acting and cheesy special effects. The film follows a group of military personnel stranded on an island with a giant komodo dragon and a python blocking their escape. The movie is rated PG-13 and bleeps out curse words with parrot noises. While it fails as a horror movie, it succeeds as a comedy. The rating is one star out of four.",0
"This is a great feel-good movie to watch with loved ones, without the typical girly elements found in American movies. The simple plot is relatable and the characters are amazing, with hilarious Jewish humor throughout. The movie will make you think, laugh, and want to own it.",1
"Despite positive reviews, I found the movie to be heavy-handed, predictable, and not scary. The first 30 minutes were promising, but it went downhill from there. The score was typical of a horror movie, and there was little originality. The romantic interest was obvious, and the second half was ridiculous. I chose to laugh at the movie's absurdity for the final 30 minutes.",0
"Griffith's Battle at Elderbrush Gulch is his longest and most expensive short film to date, showcasing his attempt to perfect large-scale action scenes for future full-length features. The western setting provides an ideal backdrop for action, with the story following a pair of vulnerable children and their mother, as well as some puppies, who are at risk of being captured by the Indians. The action sequence is complex and layered, blending the trapped heroine scenario with battles, but some viewers have criticized the offensive portrayal of Native Americans, although the Indian Chief's son's waistcoat and the ""war dance"" suggest they are actually cockneys.",1
"This review warns that the movie is poorly constructed and relies on cheap scare tactics. The plot is disappointing and lacks analysis of the killer's psychology. The acting is also criticized, particularly that of Cary Elwes. The reviewer regrets wasting money on the movie and advises others to avoid it.",0
"Most viewers of ""Rapid Exchange"" were either crew members, friends of the crew, or fans of Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. Despite being the headliner, Henriksen's character only appears at the beginning of the movie. The pre-heist scenes were decent, but the heist itself is dragged out and boring. The characters lack personality, but there are some unintentional laughs. Overall, it's a bad movie, but not the worst.",0
"Initially hesitant to watch an old film, I eventually watched it with a friend and my father and ended up loving it. The songs and actors were great, and I even bought the film and watched it with my classmates on my birthday. It's a nice, good, and sometimes funny film that proves age doesn't determine quality. I recommend giving it a chance, as you can always stop watching if you don't like it.",1
"The movie is primarily composed of flashbacks and discussions about a crucial moment that occurred before the movie began. The lack of context and indication of when events are taking place can be frustrating. The plot revolves around a discussion of good versus evil and the killing of a mentally challenged boy, which occurred before the movie began. The lead character's mental state is unclear, but he appears slow and detached. The movie provides no answers, only questions, and is not recommended.",0
"The author has disliked all of the Jean Rollin movies they have seen, finding them boring and featuring the same concept of lesbian vampires. However, they found ""Night of the Hunted"" to be the most compelling and inventive Rollin film they have seen, although it still had a nonsensical plot and emotionless sex sequences. The lead actress and musical score were the only elements that kept the author engaged. The plot follows a young woman with amnesia who is kidnapped and taken to a sinister apartment complex with others in a similar mental state. The denouement is revealed to be dumb and illogical. The film features weird and senseless sequences, cheap makeup effects, and dire sex footage.",0
"The film did not meet expectations due to a simple and inconsistent plot that did not evolve. The main character's portrayal was unconvincing, except for Diane Lane's performance. The reviewer had high expectations but was disappointed.",0
"This movie, labeled as a comedy, was not funny and lacked direction and well-developed characters. The lead actor, Alex Ferns, was decent and the ending was unexpected, but overall it failed to be a good comedy or drama. It does not benefit the working class characters it portrays and is best avoided.",0
"The film GUEST HOUSE PARADISO lacked artificial lighting, making it difficult to see, but the dialogue made up for it.",0
"The cartoon was not the expected cat and mouse duo and was instead a racist portrayal of African Americans in ""blackface"" fashion. The cartoon has poor animation and is not recommended for children. ""Plane"" unnecessary and receives a score of -1 out of 10.",0
"The article discusses the film ""Never Say Never Again,"" which is Sean Connery's last Bond film and a remake of ""Thunderball."" The author believes that the Bond series should have ended with this film or ""License to Kill"" due to the importance of characterization and the fact that the series should not go on forever. Despite being a remake, the film stands out with its high-tech gadgets, great villains, and excellent supporting cast. The author recommends watching the film to find out more.",1
"The most captivating scene in the movie is the silent jewel heist, executed masterfully by a group of strangers who come together for the job. The film includes slow scenes, such as the introduction of the two main characters and the inclusion of a third man, Jansen, who is a drug addict but becomes a sharp shooter for the heist. The police inspector, Mattei, is portrayed inconsistently throughout the film. The opening scene with a red stop light may hold hidden meaning. The movie is long but doesn't feel that way, and the ending is rushed. Overall, the film is rated 9/10.",1
"This film is a masterpiece that is beautiful, sad, frightening, and thought-provoking. The plot is captivating, with a surprising twist that made me scream and an ending that made me cry. I recommend it to anyone who wants to experience an interesting plot with scary scenes and atmosphere. However, be aware that the ending is very sad, which fits the mood of the film.",1
"Campfire Tales is a surprisingly enjoyable horror film with well-paced and satisfying stories. Although one story lacks explanation, the overall experience is entertaining and suspenseful. The film is a hidden horror gem that is worth recommending to others. It receives a rating of 7/10.",1
"The horror movie's ending was disappointing and unrealistic, with a ghost father appearing to cure the girl. The reviewer found it to be the worst horror movie they've seen in a long time and criticized the use of CGI. They recommend watching the original or other horror movies instead.",0
"The film, directed by Jesus Ponce and rated 8 out of 10, tells the story of a homeless couple surviving on the streets. The woman, recently released from prison, meets her boyfriend, a drug addict, and they live together under a dilapidated building. Despite their imperfections, the audience sympathizes with them due to their broken backgrounds. The woman dreams of a normal life but doesn't expect it to happen. The man's drug obsession worsens while the woman perseveres. The film has a nice melodramatic conclusion and is a wonderful independent film about the relationship between two misfits.",1
"Many people have varying opinions on the show ICarly, with some finding it entertaining and others finding it dull and idiotic. The show has been criticized for its use of stereotypes, silly plotlines, and overuse of recurring jokes. Additionally, the webshow within the show has been criticized for overusing 3DFX and spilling personal information. The show is also targeted towards a female audience and has been known to insult various famous things. Part 3 of the review will be released in early Spring.",0
"The musical version of James Hilton's story, GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS, was initially criticized by reviewers in London and the US, leading MGM to cut most of its songs. However, when watched years later, the film is a delightful love story with Peter O'Toole giving a great performance as ""Chipping"" and Petula Clark playing a beautiful and understanding Catherine. The songs fit the story well and the direction by Herbert Ross brings the film to life. While it may be too romantic for some, it is a beautifully acted and directed love story.",1
"Some may consider Jack Frost 2 a guilty pleasure, but I enjoyed it without any guilt. The movie has a cheesy and amateurish feel, but it's clear that the cast and crew had fun making it. The deaths of the three women on the beach and the scene with the surfers are particularly memorable. The snowball children are also impressive. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is a pleasure to watch.",1
"The film is racially prejudiced against Hayden Panettiere as she is constantly called ""white girl"" and other slurs. The stereotyping of the ethnic kids from the inner city school is also a disgrace. The film misses the point that the inner city school wins the cheerleading competition through intimidation, not talent. The film is not a harmless lighthearted comedy suitable for a family audience and is a waste of time.",0
"The Protector, a Jackie Chan film, is not worth watching as it was ruined by Americans. Chan made a better cop film called Police Story in 1985.",0
"Despite its intention, this movie was hilarious due to the ridiculous acting, voices, and plot. It mainly consisted of a man wandering around a corn maze for an hour and a half, with a poorly executed supernatural element added in. The creepy music played throughout the film, making it even more bizarre. Although it was expected to be a horror movie like Children of the Corn, it was just plain stupid. The main character aimlessly searched for two little girls and ended up killing someone at the end. It's only worth watching with friends for a good laugh, but not as a horror movie.",0
"I enjoyed the light-hearted movie ""Marigold"" without any prior expectations. The contemporary music and sharp dancing, along with the English dialog, made it a fun musical people movie. However, subtitles would have been helpful during quick moments with difficult accents. I appreciate Ali Larter's acting and have watched the movie multiple times.",1
"I went into ""States of Grace"" with an open mind, hoping that Dutcher had improved as a filmmaker since ""God's Army."" However, the shaky acting and improbable storyline left me disappointed. Dutcher's inaccurate portrayal of Mormon missionaries only served to alienate his predominantly Mormon audience, and the conclusion was both unbelievable and cheesy. He should try making a movie that is relatable to someone.",0
"Despite being considered uncool by many classic rock fans, this DVD showcases the impressive musicianship and extensive catalogue of Rush, a band that has faced criticism from music journalists throughout their 30-year history. The performance is almost flawless, with high-quality sound and visuals, and includes a documentary and multi-angled set pieces. This is a must-have for serious classic rock fans.",1
"This women-in-prison film is below average, with poorly directed sex scenes and bad dialogue. Despite the abundance of nudity, the sex scenes lack eroticism and drag on. It has some production value, but ranks lower than Chained Heat and higher than Frauen fur Zellenblock Neun on the W-i-P scale.",0
"John Hughes, once talented, now produces idiotic comedy by recycling the 'Home Alone' formula in a film where a baby crawls around Chicago while inept kidnappers try to catch him. The laziness of the movie is most glaring in scenes where crowds of people fail to notice the baby.",0
The film is less entertaining than being eaten by snakes.,0
"The movie is predictable and filled with stereotypical characters. The storyline is similar to ""Sister Act"" and lacks direction and acting skill. Small details are overlooked, making the movie even more flawed. The ending is improbable.",0
"Purchasing this movie was a regrettable expense as it is extremely dull, with the exception of the ending which, despite being great, is not enough to redeem the film due to its sluggish pace.",0
"Alice, a translator in Italy, suffers from memory loss and follows fragments of memory to Garma where she suspects her nightmares are linked to her amnesia. The movie has a good plot with unexpected twists, but is slow and arty. Florinda Bolkan is good in her role and Klaus Kinski's role is too small. It's a nice mystery, but not for gore or exploitation fans.",1
"The movie is shockingly trite and cliché, with comical moments in the final 20 minutes. The dialogue is unpleasant, but the attractive women on screen are the only redeeming factor. It is not recommended to watch, with a rating of 2 out of 10.",0
"This movie is a favorite of mine and one of the best comic book adaptations. It's a mix of X-men and The Matrix, with Wesley Snipes doing a great job as Blade. The movie is not sugarcoated for a PG-13 rating and has a realistic feel with some cursing. It also has a good final fight, unlike many Batman movies.",1
"The movie is highly enjoyable with memorable lines and scenes, and is based on a famous story. It is recommended to watch, but caution is advised for those with weak bladders.",1
"The film is about a columnist for a homemaking magazine who must pretend to have a perfect home life when her boss and a war hero visit for Christmas, despite living in a small apartment and not being married or having a baby. The resulting comedy and romance make it a must-see for classic movie fans.",1
"I watched the film with horror because my mother was also a crack addict like Michelle. I have searched for my mother in dangerous places before, but I was more afraid to leave her there. I wondered where Michelle slept during her addiction. The scene of Tracy shooting up in an Old Navy dressing room was the worst for me. I am curious about where Matt and Tracy are now and if there is an update on their lives in 2008.",1
"Despite its flaws, ""Thing"" has potential for an interesting, creepy story in the hands of a skilled writer like Theodore Sturgeon or Robert Bloch. However, the story was poorly executed as a feature length movie with unconvincing characters, slow pacing, and a bad anti-climax. The director is to blame for the poor performances of the actors. There are some effective shots and ideas, but overall, the movie is bad. The author is charitable towards the movie due to budget and time constraints.",0
"The movie started well, but the soundtrack was bad and the story became too dark for the original book. The Marchioness character was unnecessary and the General's complexity was lost. Peter Firth's singing was painful and the acting needed improvement. The film would have been better with a different soundtrack and the DVD quality was poor. The reviewer compares it unfavorably to Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.",0
"The movie is a beautiful work of art that tells the story of a woman gymnast who is unsatisfied with her life and meets another woman during her acrobatic training. They develop an intimate and beautiful relationship that brings meaning back into her life. The movie captures the main character's feelings and emotions through stunning choreography and imagery. The story is simple yet sensual, leaving a lot of room for interpretation. The relationship with her close friend is also beautiful and shows what a true friend is. Overall, it is a wonderful and touching movie that is worth watching.",1
This Hollywood film is the scariest ever made and shows how the industry ruins great works of art for profit. It exposes the reality of Hollywood: money over quality. It makes the reader question how many great films have been lost to mediocrity. Watch Spoorloos or read The Golden Egg if you want to be haunted forever. The author wishes they could give the film a zero rating.,0
"The story is about a schizophrenic patient and explores the perceptions and realities of the people in her life. It touches on themes of physics, medicine, religion, and politics. The movie includes scenes that comment on these themes, such as the use of shock treatment and the belief in ghosts. The film also questions what is true and real. The director could have gone further in exploring the question of whether belief in God is delusional. The movie is a more intricate exploration of the schizophrenic mind than ""A Beautiful Mind"" and deserves recognition for its story, screenplay, direction, and acting.",1
"The movie has a promising start with the accident and decision to not return to LA, but the plot progresses too quickly and many scenes don't make sense. The acting also declines towards the end. The last 45 minutes are ridiculous and not worth watching unless you want to see how bad it is.",0
"This RKO Saint film has a great original script, good camera work, directing, editing, and acting. George Sanders is charming and Jonathan Hale is perfect as Inspector Fernack. The story starts on an ocean liner where the Saint meets Wendie Barrie, but she breaks his heart in the end. The Saint helps Inspector Fernack clear his name and there are a few deaths along the way. Overall, it's a good film and worth watching.",1
"Before Sky High and Zoom, there was Hero High, a cartoon about teenagers with superpowers attending a school for superheroes in training. They helped police catch bad guys and got into embarrassing situations. The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam was a live-action stage show featuring the voice actors dressed as their characters. The cast was great at delivering jokes. The cartoon was a fun superhero comedy that could potentially come back in live-action like Fat Albert.",1
"Rififi is a perfect heist film that stands out from all others. The simple plot is captivating and the characters are presented as flawed human beings. The 30-minute heist scene is famous, but the film gets even better afterward. The director's decision to not have music during the heist scene or final shootout was a great choice. The film would not have been as good if it was made as an American film during that time. A remake with Al Pacino is unnecessary and the classics should be left alone.",1
"I watched a movie with James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll that exceeded my expectations. Despite being made in the early/mid 70's, it's a decent drama that runs for about 90 minutes. The plot is conventional but told from the perspective of a single black woman on welfare with 6 children. The script is not overly sentimental and provides a glimpse into the past with 70's styles. The ending is a bit strange and could have been better without the theatrics.",1
"The documentary showcases Istanbul's diverse culture through various genres of music, including famous and street musicians, revealing the different faces of the city.",1
"Despite hearing positive reviews about the movie being gory and action-packed, my personal experience was disappointing. Killpoint lacked the promised brutality and gore, with many scenes of people getting shot without any blood. It was a bad movie that could have been rated PG even by 1984 standards.",0
"David Hemmings' adventure film about salvaging a WWII plane with valuable cargo is a disappointment compared to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. The film has some positive aspects, such as beautiful New Zealand settings and Brian May's music score, but the negative aspects far outweigh the good. The acting is poor, the dialog is painful, and the direction is inept. The script is obvious and terrible, with jokes falling flat and scenes lacking punch. Two men were killed during the making of the film, making it a waste.",0
"The film was funded by the US Army and promoted before the elections, raising questions about its intent. It is suspected to be propaganda, and the involvement of the Army's PR firm and lack of transparency about funding adds to this suspicion. A documentary would be preferred over an edited version by the Bush Administration.",0
"The show ""The 11th Hour"" is poorly executed and lacks scientific accuracy. The plot involves a caretaker being brought to a church to confess and reveal information about a cloning case. The main character, Stewart, is a government scientist with no specific area of expertise. The show includes a scene where Picard rages at a TV advertisement and a cartoonish ending. The show argues against cloning on the basis of unique souls but supports stem cell research without providing examples. Overall, the show relies on buzzwords and lacks substance.",0
"I watched my first Almodavar film mainly because of Antonio Banderas' gay sex scenes, but unfortunately, that was the only good thing about it. Despite being a sophisticated viewer who enjoys European and art films, I found the plot ridiculous, the characters lifeless, and the supposed comedy unfunny. The film was poorly constructed with pointless dialogue, and I don't understand why it was made. Can someone explain it to me?",0
"The film ""Love in a Different Climate"" is a disappointing Bollywood production that lacks musical numbers and a compelling story. The script is poorly written and the direction is disjointed. The plot revolves around a gay medical student named Jimi who is forced into an arranged marriage with a woman from Delhi. His family is unaware of his sexuality and he goes along with the plan until a lie is told that derails the wedding. The cast performs well, but the film is too superficial and fails to make the audience care about the characters.",0
"The film is set in Siberia and follows a hermit fur trapper named Avakum who accompanies his friend's son on a hunt for two tigers that are preying on farms. During the hunt, Avakum accidentally shoots and kills his friend's son while trying to save him from a tiger attack. Avakum attempts to leave the village but is confronted by a lynch mob. The film explores the conflict between man and nature, with a strong soundtrack by Jimmie Haskell. The film is not widely available for purchase.",1
"This movie is so bad that it's funny, especially if you enjoy Ken Russell's worst work. Kathleen Turner plays a woman who pretends to be a prostitute due to past trauma, and Tony Perkins plays a priest who may want to kill her. Annie Potts is also in the movie but doesn't get to be funny. The unrated version has kinky sex scenes, including one where Turner uses a cop's billy club.",0
"The Swedish splatter movie is not common in today's b-movie industry, which is struggling compared to its golden days. Despite good special effects, the movie has too much dialogue and lacks enough gore. Gert Fylking's role as a sergeant is hilariously bad, but overall there is little else to recommend unless one is desperate for Swedish b-movies. The movie receives a 4/10 rating.",0
"The movie is confusing and poorly acted, particularly by Laura Mennell. Despite this, there are several positive reviews on IMDb, all from users with only one review, leading the author to suspect they may be fake. The movie is titled ""11.11 - The New Prophecy"" in Brazil. The author gives it a rating of three.",0
"The film adaptation of the book ""A Little Princess"" is a disappointment and does not capture the true story and messages of the book. The book is about love, honorable behavior, self-control, and humility, while the film is an awful adaptation. The main character, Sara, behaves honorably regardless of circumstances and influences others to change their behaviors. The film alters the excellent book in a bad direction and is not worth watching. It is recommended to read the book instead.",0
"The movie about Stu Ungar's life was unnecessarily creative and inaccurate. Stu's life was already interesting enough without embellishment. The movie included several inaccuracies, such as Stu's journey to Las Vegas and his association with a casino executive. Additionally, the movie falsely portrayed a magical turnaround leading up to the 1997 WSOP. The only redeeming quality of the movie was Michael Imperolli's performance. Overall, the movie received a rating of 4 out of 10 stars.",0
"I enjoyed watching the funny film starring popular Turkish actor Cuneyt Arkin, who has played tough-guy, epic-sword, and romantic roles. It was entertaining to see him with an international cast and wearing a pair of bad-looking gloves. The film was also dubbed in English, adding to the humor.",1
"The writer considers the movie ""Cheerleader Massacre"" to be a typical slasher film with common elements such as teenage girls, foolish male characters, and a spooky setting. Despite this, the movie has some unique plot twists that make it slightly better than other similar films. It was surprising that the movie was made in 2003, as the writer thought these types of movies stopped being made in the 80s. Overall, the movie is worth watching if you have time to spare.",0
"Despite some calling it one of the best movies ever, I find the film lacking in story, dialogue, artistic value, and acting. If you want to appear artistic, you can say you like it, but if you have a genuine opinion, explain why you don't like it or why you do.",0
"Hell Ride is a disappointing movie with a weak plot and character development. It borrows heavily from other films, such as Pulp Fiction and No Country, and the acting is not believable. The inclusion of Dennis Hopper and the Easy Rider motif is unnecessary. The blame lies with Larry Bishop for his poor writing and failed attempt at the leading role. It's not worth watching.",0
"The movie was terrible, with a plot about a female prisoner sent to space to save humanity, but instead it focused solely on a lesbian commander and their repeated sexual encounters. The footage seemed unnecessary and only served to create a soft porn film. The creature was only shown halfway through and resembled the alien from the movie with Sigourney Weaver. It's not worth watching and has nothing to do with science fiction, but rather seems geared towards young adolescent boys. It received a rating of 1 out of 10.",0
"I played Sam in the film ""Dead Rail"" which later aired as ""Alien Express."" It was a great opportunity for me to work with talented people and gain experience as an actor. The cast and crew were amazing, and I made many friends. Despite the low budget, a lot of time and effort went into the production. Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges, and Steven Brand were fantastic people to work with. I miss them and hope they are doing well.",1
"The author, a parent of two girls, has concerns about TV shows aimed at tweens. They believe that these shows present unrealistic living conditions and unrealistic expectations about work and luxury. Additionally, the shows often depict broken families without any negative consequences, and do not address spirituality. The author is troubled by the message that being good at something is not important, and instead encourages blending in and making jokes. They give these shows a zero rating and are close to forbidding them in their home.",0
"Sinatra delivers a powerful portrayal of drug addiction in this film, which could serve as a cautionary tale for young audiences. The story follows a man trying to turn his life around but is pulled back into the world of drugs and gambling by those around him. The soundtrack, featuring heavy jazz, adds to the film's mood. Recommended for fans of film noir, zoot suits, fedoras, or jazz.",1
"""The Cure"" is a valuable teaching resource for junior high and high school teachers, whether used alongside ""Huckleberry Finn"" or as a separate lesson. While AIDS is the main theme, the underlying message of friendship and love between Eric and Dexter is a powerful one for teenagers. Writing prompts focusing on the symbolism of the tennis shoe are effective, and class discussion about Eric's transformation from manipulative user to loving friend is recommended.",1
"The movie is rated 10/10 and considered one of the best the reviewer has seen. It deals with cruel realities and has a lasting impact. The reviewer emphasizes that the movie's quality is not based on national preference and it could be remade with modern technology. However, the movie's message may be best understood by young adults.",1
"Granny is one of the worst horror movies ever made with a terrible script, bad acting, laughable murders, no suspense, ineffective camera work, and an inappropriate plot twist. The Granny character is unthreatening and looks like she's wearing a cheap mask and frilly nightgown. It's a must-see for those who enjoy bad movies but should be avoided by those who don't.",0
"After watching two successful Merchant-Ivory films, we searched for a hard-to-find VHS despite its failure at the box office and as a rental. The film, ""Jefferson in Paris,"" was part of a Liberal Agenda to discredit the Founding Fathers, including the alleged Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson connection. The movie is dull and uninteresting, reducing a significant moment in American history to a cure for insomnia. The Liberal Spin Job is evident throughout the film, including the opening scene where James Earl Jones claims to be Jefferson's son. The reason for the Liberal Agenda's attack on the Founding Fathers is unknown and not worth explaining.",0
"The movie depicts the deep friendship between Orry and George, which is tested during the Civil War. As a Southerner, the accuracy of the film is appreciated, especially the portrayal of brothers fighting each other. The most moving scene is when President Lincoln shows mercy towards the South, acknowledging that enough blood has been shed. The movie is highly recommended as a reminder of the dark times our country faced during the war.",1
"Despite the incredible performances of Sidney Poitier and Joanna Going, the tiresome morality play about racism in the old West could not be saved by the screenplay, co-stars, directing, and score, leading one to understand why Poitier may want to die after starring in such rubbish.",0
"George Burns reprises his role as God in a family-oriented film where he appears to a young girl named Louanne and asks her to spread his Divine Word, causing trouble with adults. The writing is a mix of slapstick and seriousness, making God seem more like a troublemaker than a friend. Louanne's untrained acting occasionally seems awkward, and the production has a TV-movie appearance. The final scene brings a welcomed wistful sentiment.",0
"The movie ""Eternal Evil"" features the threat of astral projection causing harm to those close to the person with the ability. Karen Black plays Janus, a dying woman who needs a new body and influences a commercial director, Paul Sharpe, to become her host. A detective investigating the unusual homicides links Paul to the deaths and uncovers Janus. The film has a weird atmosphere and an intriguing premise, but the pacing is slow, the cast is limp, and the main character is difficult to like. Karen Black's character is not prominent enough, and the film misses an opportunity to showcase her acting.",0
"Matt Cvetic is an FBI agent posing as a Communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill, trying to gather information about party activities. He struggles with recruiting workers into the party, which isolates him from his family and neighbors. The party plans to create a strike at the mill, and Cvetic must also deal with a party member who discovers his true identity. The film lacks suspense and action, and the cast seems unenthusiastic. It received an Oscar nomination for best documentary, but is rated 4 out of 10.",0
"Although it has some good scenes, ""The Hospital"" is mostly awful and falls short of being a classic. Chayefsky tries too hard to create obstacles for the hospital and the acting is mostly one-dimensional, with the exception of Hughes. Scott is passable, Rigg seems miscast, and Dysart mugs through his brief performance. It may have been more effective as a commentary on the healthcare industry as a whole.",0
"WHISTLING IN THE DARK received an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s despite weak one-liners and an unrealistic plot. However, Red Skelton fans may enjoy the amiable cast and Conrad Veidt's interesting villain. The comedy requires viewers to accept the lack of credibility and overlook the flat gags, which is not always easy for a discriminating viewer.",1
"The movie is disliked due to the actors' appearance and the potential for viewers to believe false information. The Second Coming of Christ will not be in human form, but in God's full Glory. The movie portrays eternal Gay pride, which goes against the Bible's teachings. Following the Bible word for word would result in executions, but misinforming people is more harmful. Making a movie about someone claiming to be The Son of God is questionable.",0
"Despite being a fan of Jess Franco's trash movies, I find that they often have missed opportunities and poorly executed plots. This film, which combines the theme of 'The Most Dangerous Game' with Franco's usual sleaze, suffers from a lost plot and a slow start. The sex scenes and general sleaze are boring, and the only positive is the catchy soundtrack. I only recommend this film to those who want to see all of Franco's movies, and suggest watching 'Vampyros Lesbos', 'Faceless', or 'She Killed in Ecstasy' instead.",0
"The American version of Kath and Kim is disappointing, with wooden acting and scripted exchanges between the actors. The wardrobe and figure of the characters do not match the original, and the humor is lost. The show feels like a bad stage play and the exaggerated expressions of Selma Blair wear off quickly. The script has been dumbed down for American audiences, and it would have been better to simply show the original version. Magda is wise for not allowing her character to be used in the American version.",0
"House of Dracula is preferred over House of Frankenstein due to better acting, solid performances, and well-mixed subplots. Lon Chaney's wolfman adds a classy touch to the classic universal horror film. The doctor's performance before and after being contaminated with Dracula's blood is especially noteworthy.",1
"""Make Them Die Slowly"" is a banned ""Video Nasty"" from the 1980s that is over-hyped and typical of Umberto Lenzi's jungle potboilers, featuring poorly rendered native torture techniques, ridiculous social commentary, and gore. The violence is only briefly shown, diminishing its impact, and the dialogue is silly. Despite a cast of familiar faces, the film is a lousy effort that cannot be saved.""",0
"A co-worker recommended a scary movie, but after watching for 50 minutes, my girlfriend and I gave up. The movie lacked originality and had a slow pace with meaningless dialogue. It received a rating of 1 out of 10.",0
"""Clonus"" is a poorly produced 70's sci-fi movie with unconvincing acting, absent direction, and silly clothing. The premise of rich people cloning themselves for body parts is interesting, but the film fails to horrify or keep anyone's attention. Even B-list actors provide tepid performances. The MooCow recommends watching anything by Greydon Clark instead. The MST3K-version is also boring. Proceed at your own risk.",0
"The movie is based on the true story of Charlie Wilson, an American Congressman who played a key role in the covert war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. Tom Hanks delivers a great performance as a womanizing Congressman with a good heart, and the movie has a humorous tone. However, the story and ending are serious. The movie can be enjoyed as a comedy or a serious drama. Overall, it is rated 7/10.",1
"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" is an underrated masterpiece that surpasses ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds"" in technical artistry and brilliance. Robert Walker's performance as the father-hating, mother-fixated villain Bruno is disturbing and stunning, while Farley Granger's portrayal of the troubled protagonist is convincing. The film is a game of cat-and-mouse that is subtly sexual in detail and fits into the film-noir category. Hitchcock's camera-work and the premise are to-die-for, and the cross-cutting between the characters is magnificent. The film is a daring masterpiece that subverts normal, everyday events like no other.",1
"I watched the film out of curiosity, especially since it starred Kane Hodder. However, my hope for the movie faded as it inaccurately portrayed Eddie Gein as a hulking killing machine. The movie lacked direction and the director seemed to know nothing about the subject. There are already enough films about Gein's story, and I recommend the more authentic 2001 film ""Ed Gein (aka In the Light of the Moon)"".",0
"The ""Stranger Within"" thriller genre can be enjoyable if done well, but ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" fails to deliver. The main issue is the poorly written and acted villain, Peyton Flanders. The other actors, such as Annabella Sciorra and Julianne Moore, do a good job, but the script lets them down. Director Curtis Hanson's efforts are also lacking, resulting in a poorly paced film with a laughable climax. This movie is not worth watching and should have gone straight to video.",0
"While channel surfing, I discovered a short film on an obscure program in Australia that left me amazed. Despite its brevity, the story, acting, and cinematography were all impressive. I would love to add it to my DVD collection and eagerly anticipate the director's next work. Overall, it was an exceptional experience that I would rate 10/10.",1
The movie starts with an impressive aerial shot but quickly becomes boring and one-dimensional. The characters lack depth and the story lacks thrills and suspense. The soundtrack is too classy for the material and the director's approach is too tame. The gore is good but the director holds back too much. The movie is a butchered version of the book and not worth watching.,0
I love this movie even though I haven't played Final Fantasy VII. The voice-over actors did a great job and the visuals are fantastic. I suggest watching it twice and with subtitles on for better understanding.,1
"The Thing is a great horror movie with realistic effects before CGI. Set in Antarctica, American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base and bring back a lethal creature that can absorb and become anyone or anything it wants. The film turns into a brilliant paranoia piece as fear rules supreme and no one trusts anyone anymore. The gore effects are amazing and messily realistic. The power of the film lies in its paranoia and the real threat that cannot be seen or easily detected. This is one of Carpenter's best films with strong performances and powerful special effects.",1
"Anne of the Indies is an adventure pirate movie directed by Jacques Tourneur and written by Phillip Dunne. The film is based on the real woman-pirate Anne Boney who sailed through the 18th century's Atlantic. The story follows the main character, captain Anne Providence, who falls in love with a French officer but later discovers he has a wife. Anne plans revenge but ends up making a sacrifice to save them instead. The film has classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in Technicolor.",1
"""The Phenix City Story"" is a rare hero-centered anti-crime film that delves into the activities of ethical opponents rather than criminals. Director Phil Karlson's work on this film and ""Kansas City Confidential"" helped him secure his directorial assignment on ""The Untouchables"" TV series. The movie is a powerful and gritty portrayal of the struggle against corrupt vice gangs in Alabama's Phenix City. The film follows John Patterson's return from Germany, where he was a prosecutor, and his pursuit of the 14th street vicelords. The movie features well-developed characters and a swift-paced, straightforward story that divides into parts. The film's ending is upbeat, but the prognosis for the town is less sanguine than painted.",1
"Ridley Scott is a successful director and producer who has made popular films like ALIEN, GLADIATOR, and BLADE RUNNER. However, his early film school project is unimpressive despite some good camera work and style. The film was not intended for general release and is part of the CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD, which includes 16 shorts, including some great ones like THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT, and WASP. This DVD is recommended for short film enthusiasts.",0
"While watching ""Wirey Spindell,"" I found the portrayal of the character amusing. However, I was puzzled by the fact that the actor who played Wirey in high school was only 10 years old. Later, the actor played Wirey as a senior in high school at the age of 20, which I found humorous.",1
"Raquel Welch stars in a 1969 film where her character, Michele, meets with friends before being shot by her ex-husband. Michele and her friend Jackie go to the police station while Nikki dies in the hospital. Michele heads to Los Angeles and gets a job as a dancer with Jeri, where she meets bouncer Joe. The film is praised for its nonstop action and Welch's fantastic performance. The reviewer gives the movie 10 stars for Welch's acting and the exciting plot.",1
"Despite feeling tired, I decided to watch Little Dieter Needs to Fly at the 1999 Göteborg Filmfestival due to its high rating on IMDB. The film, which lasts 80 minutes, is a captivating portrayal of Dieter Dengler's life and is highly recommended to be watched in a cinema.",1
"The author comments on Steamboat Willie, one of the first cartoons with sound, featuring Mickey Mouse driving a steamboat and using animals as instruments. The film is groundbreaking and the third Mickey Mouse cartoon, with a more violent portrayal of the character. The author rates it 9/10 and recommends watching Plane Crazy.",1
"Hayao Miyazaki's ""Ponyo"" is a children's fairytale about a fish who becomes a little girl and befriends a young boy named Sosuke. The film is full of visual creativity and imaginative elements, but lacks conflict and danger. Despite this, it is heart-warming and charming, and will satisfy Miyazaki's fans and newcomers alike. The film has been dubbed over with Western voices, including those of Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers.",1
"I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching a terrible sci-fi movie with a nonsensical story, poorly developed characters, and a bad cast. Despite the illogical IMDb User Rating and some ""ten stars"" reviews, I found the movie to be garbage. The authors of the positive reviews only had one short review each, and I question why they would promote such a terrible film. My vote is one.",0
"Renoir's French Cancan is a charming film with a cliché story about a laundry girl who is discovered by a night club owner and has to choose between her humble life with her baker boyfriend or continuing with the show. The film ends with the opening of Danglard's new night club, the Moulin Rouge, and features a gorgeous song and dance number. The film also has a cute leading lady.",1
"The author is a big fan of Steve Buscemi and enjoyed his directorial debut, ""Trees Lounge,"" but was disappointed by his film ""Lonesome Jim."" The author found the film boring and lacking in substance, blaming the casting of Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler for the lack of charisma. The author believes that Buscemi let his fans down with this film.",0
"This action film is extremely boring and lacks interesting villains, but Chuck Norris saves it from being unbearable. The low budget is evident and the direction, acting, and dialog are all terrible. The film is not worth watching and should be avoided. Chuck Norris is the only redeeming factor.",0
"The film features a librarian who dreams of a world filled with uninhibited people who love to sing, dance, and engage in sensual adventures. Originally shot as an erotic poem with explicit scenes, the theatrical release had those scenes cut, but some were added back in for videocassette versions. Despite its low budget, the film has impressive cinematography, professional dances and acting, making it one of the best adult fairy tales. Playboy model Kristine DeBell plays the librarian.",1
The film is criticized for being a classic despite having a low body count and filled with melodrama. The plot involves a family encountering a mad dog while getting their car fixed. The child character is annoying and the mother's actions are illogical. The film lacks tension and is poorly written. A better alternative is John Lafia's Man's Best Friend.,0
"I recently saw the closing film at the Austin Film Festival and was pleasantly surprised by the epic theme music and clever use of tarot cards in the title sequence. The film features cameos from Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and the dark lord, who has a fetish for KG. The songs are catchy and the car chase scene is a standout. I believe this film will quickly gain a cult following and attract new fans to Tenacious D.",1
"This movie is exceptional and emotionally complex, exploring extreme love and passion with breathtaking cinematography. The character of the Count is intensely passionate and tragic, and the film is perfectly cast and acted with mathematical precision. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama, and politics, making it unmissable and deserving of all the hype and awards. Michael Ondaatje's incredible book serves as the basis for this masterpiece.",1
"Although many comments criticized the movie's flaws, I found it relatable despite the director and actors not being top-notch. The plot revolves around finishing school and attending a big party, which can be seen as a metaphor for choosing one's path in life. The movie may evoke memories of youthful days and regrets about not acting like the characters. If you ask yourself these questions, the movie may not seem so bad.",1
"""The China Syndrome"" is a top-notch thriller with an unexpected and logical ending. The film features strong performances from three Oscar-winning actors and has no music score, allowing the story and characters to take center stage. The plot revolves around a nuclear power plant accident and the characters' attempts to expose the truth, resulting in a complex morality play that relies on human nature rather than a traditional villain. Overall, the film is highly recommended.",1
"I stumbled upon a free preview of a movie about a young rocker's journey to learn heavy metal. Despite low expectations from promotional posters, the movie was a heavy comedy and a lot of fun. Jack Black's talent as a comedian, actor, and musician shines through. If you remember the dominance of Heavy Metal in the 80s, you'll love this film. Check out Tenacious D.",1
A TALE OF TWO SISTERS is a Korean horror-drama that surprises with clever twists and impressive cinematography. It is more complicated and intelligent than other famous Japanese horror movies and has a great musical score. The story starts slow but becomes intense and scary with successful surprise-scares. It is a small masterpiece that works on both psychological and supernatural levels and ranks among the finest Asian horror movies. It is best to watch without knowing anything about it and give it full attention for its 110 minutes running time.,1
"The movie ""Richtofen and Brown"" is not a good WWI film. The acting is stiff and miscast, the dialogue is dumb, and the flying sequences are repetitive. It should not have been made compared to the excellent ""Blue Max."" Don't waste your time or money on it.",0
"The movie portrays Leila's dissatisfaction with her husband Jim, who prioritizes work over their relationship. She leaves him to see if he misses her, and he eventually tries to make amends. However, Leila finds a new man named Schuyler who is more attentive to her. In the end, Leila realizes that she should have stayed with Jim, who eventually changes and becomes successful.",1
"Less Than Zero could have been a revealing portrayal of extreme teenage apathy if it had followed the book, but the movie still effectively portrays the unsettling story of societal outcast teens faced with the dilemma of their friend confessing to killing a girl. Keanu Reeves is the only character with a conscience, while others either ignore the death or help hide the body. The film features disturbing performances from Crispin Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Josh Miller, and highlights the detachment these kids face. It is not a typical 80s teen movie and may require a comedy to recover from its impact.",1
"Pierre Jolivet portrays a Don Quixote-like character who lives in a world incompatible with modern life and relies on homemade weaponry made from discarded items. He rides a contraption in search of adventure and to uphold values unfamiliar to others in the story. Unlike Cervantes's tale, the audience identifies more directly with the main character's anachronistic ideals and hopes for his triumph. The movie portrays the main character as a true knight among a world of humans-as-animals, and the audience values the same visions and ideals as the crusading main character.",1
"The movie features tough biker characters with no real plot, but some well-filmed scenes. A better movie could be made with the same cast and crew, focusing on the coolest character and a continuous story. The current movie is a series of character introductions with no substance, set in the desert with perfect hair and clothes. There is a vague background story about past deaths and a treasure.",0
"The author mistakenly rented a movie that had similar packaging to ""Girlfight"". The plot involves a young Latina woman who becomes a boxer to avenge her friend's injury. The movie was predictable and had bad dialogue, but the lead actress was good and there were strong female Latino role models. The final fight scene was interesting, but there were no surprises. The movie was not terrible, but there are better options.",0
"The TV show Las Vegas is not meant to be realistic, but rather a form of escapism. The portrayal of the city as sexy and cliched is fitting, and those who do not enjoy it can simply choose not to watch. The author enjoys the show and hopes it does not get cancelled. Watching it makes them want to visit the real Las Vegas.",1
"Despite a promising opening sequence, Octopussy is a disappointing Bond film with no real plot and cringe-worthy moments, including Bond diffusing a bomb dressed as a clown. The villains, played by Louis Jordon and Kabir Bedi, are also lackluster. Despite being overlooked in discussions of the worst Bond films, Octopussy is a strong contender for the title.",0
"Although I typically enjoy Steven Seagal movies due to his incorporation of Aikido techniques, this particular film was poorly made and the blame lies with the director and producers. I left before the end because I couldn't bear to watch any more and believe others feel the same.",0
"I recently watched a 25-year-old Royal Shakespeare Company production of Macbeth that had no props or furniture except for chairs and swords, but was still captivating due to the excellent acting by trained British actors. In contrast, Al Pacino's performance as Shylock was dull and lacked humor or tragedy, despite attempts to make it so. The only redeeming qualities were the costumes, scenery, and Jeremy Irons' portrayal of a depressed character.",0
"Despite Clara Evans' attractive appearance, the show was generally bad. The author watched it due to excessive caffeine consumption and a need to unwind. The special effects and acting were subpar, and the lead actor, Boxlietner, looked older than his age. The female actors were not impressive, and the show was not up to the standards of the Sci-Fi Channel. However, for those who do not go out often, it provided a distraction from political news coverage.",0
"The DVD Cyber Zone is a poorly made B-Grade movie with bad acting and no clear genre or plot. The limited budget is evident in the reused sets and outdated special effects. The only redeeming quality is a deadpan performance by Singer. It is not worth watching, even as a joke.",0
"Although the film provided insight into JFK Jr's life, it was difficult to follow the timeline due to frequent jumps without any indication of the year. The acting was mediocre and the overall quality of the film was not exceptional, but it was informative.",1
"I bought this movie for $1.99 because it starred Harry Carey and a friend of mine. After reading positive comments, I hoped it was a forgotten gem. However, I found it to be a tedious and unrealistic film with no interesting characters or plot. Even talented actors like Harry Carey were boring in it.",0
"The Cohen brothers' film from 2000 is the best I've seen, with witty and intelligent entertainment that's unique to their style. The cast, including George Clooney and Tim Blake-Nelson, is superb. The film is a lightweight comedy with a musical touch, featuring rednecks and old-time country music, and is dripping with wit and intelligence. It's an unlikely combination, but it works perfectly.",1
"Having enjoyed Carax's ""Les Amants du Pont Neuf,"" I had high hopes for this film. However, after a decent start, it becomes a pretentious exploration of a young man's search for the meaning of life, ultimately disappointing me.",0
"""Du Levande"" by Roy Andersson, while a counterpart to his previous film ""Sånger från andra våningen,"" still exudes a sense of originality. The movie defies conventional filmmaking with its unconventional actors and long, stationary shots that build up scenery. The suspension in many scenes is high due to the time invested in each shot. The story is left for the viewer to interpret, but the movie maintains a positive outlook while addressing social injustices. The film suggests that failures and accidents may not always be fatal. Overall, it is a great movie.",1
"The emotional movie based on a true story, featuring Cuba Gooding Jr. in an award-worthy performance, is perfect for couples as it evokes various feelings and is highly enjoyable.",1
"The movie recycles 90% of the jokes from the TV series, making it unoriginal and boring for those who have already seen the show. The replacement actor for Richard Beckinsale is a lookalike but not as good. The author suggests either not making the film at all or exorcising the role out of respect for Beckinsale. The movie seems to have been made solely for profit. The author rates it 4/10.",0
"The movie was well-made and had an original concept with Mercy. Angelina did well in one of her early roles, but some of the fight scenes were corny. Overall, the reviewer enjoyed the movie and gave it a 7/10 rating.",1
"The movie had potential but was let down by a first-time director with a small budget. Rupert Everett's performance was entertaining, but there was little chemistry between the characters in the love triangle. The plot awkwardly shifted from a whodunit to a love story without proper indication. The characters' arcs were not convincing, and the ending was depressing. Overall, the movie scored 4 out of 10.",0
"Despite negative comments, I found this B movie to be a unique and enjoyable experience. It has poor acting and transitions, but is worth watching for its humor and mild gore. It may not be suitable for all audiences due to questionable themes.",1
The Ocean's 12 sequel is disappointing due to a lack of good screenplay. The author suggests donating the profits to tsunami victims and proposes a plot for Ocean's 13 involving stealing a hidden screenplay or finding 13 people to write a better one.,0
"The adaptation of Charles Kingsley's story is terrible with poor animation and disgraceful songs, particularly the repetitive ""high cockororim"" song. Despite the talents of Jon Pertwee, David Jason, and Bernerd Cirbbins, the production is depressing and should be avoided at all costs.",0
"The author has lost faith in Nickelodeon due to their new shows, including ""ICarly,"" which is now the #1 tween sitcom. The author finds the show to be effortless and poorly acted, with cliché characters and plotlines. The only redeeming factor is the character Spencer, played by Jerry Trainor. The author believes the show promotes negative behavior and has no interest in watching it or any other Nickelodeon shows.",0
"Guest House is a hilarious slapstick comedy, despite being considered tasteless and violent. Critics should be ignored as they lack a sense of humor. Although the climax loses momentum, it remains a great choice for a fun party movie. It receives a rating of seven out of ten.",1
"The movie, directed by Tim Robbins and starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, features exceptional acting that moved the viewer to tears and earned a rating of 4.75 out of 5.",1
"The film is merely the director's immature dream realized, serving as a pretext for him to romantically pursue a beautiful woman who would otherwise ignore him. The storyline is basic, the direction is absent, and the film is slow-paced with the actor/director/writer/narrator providing narration. Despite its 'X' rating, there is little nudity or violence.",0
"I am surprised that some people did not enjoy this movie, as I found it to be the funniest one I have ever seen. Perhaps it is because I am a big fan of Mel Brooks and know most of the lines. It is one of my favorites, so I do not understand why anyone would disagree. Thank you, Kristina.",1
"I watched the film because I have friends in Ukraine, but it exceeded my expectations with a perfect mix of humor and seriousness. Alex Hutz played his role well and contrasted Elijah Woods' character. The film highlights the positive side of humanity when people of different cultures come together and do the right thing, even when they have preconceived notions and prejudices. It also explores the power of memories.",1
"After watching many movies, it's hard to not see similarities in others. This film is disturbing but watchable, featuring a search for a serial killer and dream exploration. The surreal dream sequences make the film, with no need for continuity or sense. The only issue is feeling sympathy for the killer, but the focus shifts to saving the victim.",1
"The film did not seem to have a clear ending, and the plot was bizarre. The protagonist's romantic relationships were confusing, and the catchphrase was ridiculous. The ending was unsatisfying and did not explain anything. Despite this, the film was funny.",0
"The writer found the DVD of Marigold at Blockbuster and was initially skeptical due to the over-the-top costumes. However, upon seeing Salman Khan's name on the cover, they had high expectations and were pleased to find that the film exceeded them. The chemistry between Khan and Ali Larter was great, the musical numbers were surprisingly good, and the Indian costumes were not cheesy. The writer had some complaints about the DVD, such as the lack of subtitles and a blooper reel, but overall enjoyed the film and hopes to see more Bollywood hybrids featuring big name actors. They give the film a 10/10 rating.",1
"This war movie is unique in its anti-traditional approach, focusing on the de-humanization that occurs in war rather than glorifying it. The story follows Japanese soldiers stranded in the Philippines who refuse to surrender due to the logic of Bushido. The film depicts vivid scenes of starvation, madness, cannibalism, cowardice, and betrayal. It is a gritty and realistic portrayal of war that is both horrible and great.",1
"Being the son of Sean Connery does not automatically make Jason Connery an actor, as he had to work hard to land roles such as Robin Hood in ""Robin of Sherwood"" and has since moved into producing. He was not given the role in the low budget Scottish movie ""Macbeth"" because of his father's influence, and in fact, he is being cut out of Sean Connery's will. Jason has expressed frustration with constantly being compared to his father and having to justify his own abilities as an actor. It is unfair to judge him solely based on his famous parentage, and his acting skills can be seen in films such as ""Bullet to Beijing.""",1
"""The Love Letter"" is a gentle romantic comedy that uses a mysterious love letter to reveal the hidden desires of a small seaside town. Its simple and quiet tone sets it apart from typical romantic comedies, but some viewers may find it dull. The cast, including Tom Selleck and Kate Capshaw, is enjoyable, and the film provides a pleasant break from the noise of summer blockbusters.",1
"The movie tried to be good with Luke Wilson's involvement, but the flawed story and underdeveloped characters were not saved by his performance. The running ""gag"" with the bully and the barefooted kid bit were not funny. The movie felt like an average kiddie film with the mantra of adults being stupid and kids being smart, which became tiresome. The only funny moments were with the police cart Wilson drove around. Overall, the movie was not worth watching.",0
"Meatballs is a movie that frequently comes up in conversations, especially during the summer. It contains memorable scenes such as the CITs song, Rudy the Rabbit, and the hot dog eating contest. It is a cultural icon for those who appreciate non-PC humor and is a great representation of the 1970s. The writers, actors, and directors are deserving of applause.",1
"COOLEY HIGH is a comedy set in the early 60's with a great Motown soundtrack. The all-black-cast film avoids Blaxpoitation clichés and has a gritty, honest emotion that makes it stand out. Despite a tight budget, the film is warm-hearted and true-to-life. It is a sleeper hit of the 70s that is not well-known today. The DVD release is poorly done, indicating a lack of care for the film.",1
"The writer found a 3 DVD set of a WWII documentary for $5.50 at Wal-Mart. They were born in 1948 and had seen most of the episodes on TV in the 60s. The documentary was better than expected and depicted the causes and results of WWII truthfully. The Allies won the war due to their logistics and material quality. The producer, Henry Salomon, died young and the writer wants to learn more about him. The writer also had all 3 LP records of the background music, but the last one had added sound effects.",1
"This movie is only recommended for fans of Richard Pryor. The script is terrible and the movie tries to balance between comedy and melodrama but fails at both. The first 30 minutes of the movie are boring and unrealistic, depicting Vietnam prisoner of war time. The rest of the movie is filled with annoying clichés and constantly switches between tragedy and slapstick. Overall, the movie is a bad comedy and does a disservice to prisoners of war. However, if you are a fan of Richard Pryor, you may enjoy his reading of Dadaist poetry.",0
"The movie ""Glen or Glenda"" by Ed Wood features cross-dressing and bondage, with Satan making an appearance. The film attempts to portray cross-dressing sympathetically as a mental disorder rather than a perversion. Despite the lack of dialogue and pace, the movie is enjoyable in the context of Ed Wood's strange world.",0
"Howard, an English teacher in a small Indiana city, is getting married to Emily. The town is excited because Cameron, a local, has been nominated for an Oscar and wins. In his speech, Cameron thanks Howard, his high school teacher, for helping him play a gay military man. However, Howard has never come out as gay and is unsure if he should go through with the wedding. The film is a funny and humane look at the gay population, with excellent performances from the cast. It may not be suitable for those who are offended by a gay-themed film, but it offers a humorous and insightful perspective on the gay situation.",1
"The fourth Karate Kid movie was successful after replacing Ralph Macchio with Hillary Swank, who won an Oscar for her role. The author disagrees with having a girl in a karate role, but suggests Dennis Franz as a male replacement. The author also suggests Justin Guarini as a replacement for Mr. Miyagi. The movie is recommended for those looking for an exciting karate movie.",1
"The drama is about a group of international travelers who are held captive in Hungary by the Russian Communist regime in 1956. The film features talented actors such as Kerr, Robards, Jackson, and Marshall, with Ronny Howard making his screen debut. Yul Brynner plays a commanding and conflicted role as the leader of the Soviet wolves. The film is a great example of the naturalistic acting styles that are now common in modern cinema and is a must-see for fans of American film.",1
"I won't spoil Christie's great work, but I recommend watching ""After the Funeral"" before reading the book. Monica Dolan's performance as Miss Gilchrist is exceptional, particularly in her connection with Poirot and her reaction to the murderer's reveal. Despite some differences from the novel, the film's recreation of post-war England, acting, directing, and mystery make it a masterpiece. Kudos to Suchet, Dolan, and the team for their work.",1
"This important film is unfortunately unknown and rarely shown on television, despite its superb direction and acting. The film delicately explores the tragic predicament of a married couple coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter through humor, without lapsing into bad taste. A filmed theatre production with Eddie Izzard in the lead role was criticized for being insensitive and disrespectful. Despite its success as a play, the film failed to find a wide audience and is deserving of a DVD release.",1
"The film's acting is outdated and wooden, but Irene Dunne shines despite her unnatural dialogue. Only fans of classic cinema may appreciate the 1930s techniques used, otherwise the film is not worth watching.",0
"The use of ""boy cows"" to refer to the lead characters is incorrect as all male bovines are bulls and do not have udders. The inclusion of udders on male characters is bizarre and unrealistic, akin to drawing human features on animals. The lack of explanation for this choice is surprising and confusing.",0
"The film made me laugh at the beginning, but not consistently throughout. Some scenes were funny, like when the character drops a hand grenade down his sleeve. The final scene is still relevant today and shows Chaplin's great writing. The film is brave for being anti-Hitler rather than anti-Germany and has an honest message. I recommend it to anyone interested in the film or studying WWII. It's entertaining and has a message worth watching.",1
"I suggest you eat before watching this film because the bird in it made me crave chicken. ""The Giant Claw"" is a movie about a prehistoric monster that attacks planes and cities, but it is not very good. The monster's size is inconsistent and it looks like a puppet from Sesame Street, making it not very scary.",0
"""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" was remade as a musical 30 years after the original film, starring Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke. O'Toole received an Oscar nomination for his excellent performance, despite having lost the award 8 times previously. The film also featured a strong performance by Clarke, who surprised audiences with her casting as Mrs. Chippington. The film's memorable scene depicts Chips carrying on with his class despite the news of his wife's death. The film's beautiful cinematography and music enhanced the overall experience.",1
"Bloody Birthday is a film about three children born during a total eclipse who become soulless killers. The script lacks explanation for their motives and the killings are dull and unimaginative. The acting is poor and the production is forgettable. The film is unexciting and predictable, with no enjoyable aspects. It is recommended to avoid.",0
"The movie was disappointing as it lacked character development, explanation of motives and background information. The story revolves around a couple whose marriage is growing stale, and the wife's sexual fantasies lead to disastrous consequences. The acting is a mixed bag, with Donna Mills doing well, but James Brolin's performance lacking passion. The movie fails to deliver on its promise of eye candy.",0
"A wealthy businessman's daughter, who suffers from shortness of breath due to rheumatic fever, discovers her marriage to a ne'er-do-well was arranged by her father and may have only a few weeks left to live. The screenplay relies on redundant flashbacks and lacks faith in its target audience, resulting in a simplistic plot. The lead actress is not a clever heroine and the male lead lacks charm in a melodramatic setting. The film's production values are only average.",0
"In 1945, a train from Stockholm to Berlin arrives with little left of the train and some passengers. The black comedy film, directed by Peter Dalle, is acted and photographed in the style of the 1940s. The story is well-narrated and the actors had fun making it, with good timing. It is a deadly and funny film that showcases Swedish humor.",1
"Although ""Saboteur"" is not a masterpiece, it is a good film with faults such as slow-moving parts and an incomplete script due to being written in a hurry. However, Hitchcock's direction is superb and the performances are decent, with Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd standing out. The story is similar to ""39 Steps"" and ""North By Northwest"" and provides much-needed escapism. The music score is outstanding, particularly the opening title sequence, and the cinematography is crisp and smooth. The Statue of Liberty climax, circus troupe encounter, and Radio Music City Hall shoot-out are effective scenes. Overall, it is worth watching with a rating of 8/10.",1
"Allison Hayes plays Nancy Archer, the 50-Foot Woman, in the hilariously tacky film ""Aot50FW."" After encountering a giant alien in the desert, Nancy starts to grow and heads to a saloon to confront her unfaithful husband. The special effects are poorly done, making the giant creatures appear transparent. Director Nathan Juran, who also directed other giant creature films, changed his name to Nathan Hertz on the credits. The film is unintentionally funny.",0
"I expected the third movie to be suspenseful like the first two, but it lacked suspense and explanation of new dinosaurs. I lost respect for Spielberg and Crichton, but later found out they were not involved. The movie had no plot and is not worth seeing.",0
"CHE! is a poorly written and acted movie that presents a serious subject in a shallow and episodic way. Despite its flaws, the film's apparent gay subtext adds an interesting layer to the story. The recent trend of wearing Che Guevara shirts is disturbing, as he was a cold-blooded killer. A more realistic film about his life would be preferable.",0
"This is a great T & A film, similar to ""Animal House,"" with lots of breasts throughout the movie. It's a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon with several Playboy Playmates and familiar actors. The only complaint is that Lisa London's character should have had a better name. It's enjoyable but don't overthink it.",1
"""Black Jack"" is a disappointing film that even the director, Duvivier, disliked. The only noteworthy aspects are the presence of actors favored by Orson Welles and a few interesting scenes, including a cave search and a chase. Otherwise, the film is considered a failure.",0
"After watching Nightbreed for the first time in almost 20 years, the writer was impressed and couldn't find any faults with the movie. Craig Scheffer and Cronenberg's performances were outstanding, and the visuals and score were great. The writer considers it Clive Barker's best movie and gives it a 9/10 rating.",1
"This unique film presents new interpretations of the themes of the end of the world and the battle between Satan and Jesus. The film features distorted images, blurry shots, and lighting effects that are both effective and occasionally annoying. Donovan delivers a standout performance as a disillusioned Jesus struggling to understand the state of the world and its people. Despite its flaws, the film is worth watching if given the chance.",1
"As a child, I found every episode of the show to be silly. It featured puppets such as ""The Mitts,"" who discussed childhood topics and had a theme song. There was also a Groucho Marx puppet that told jokes and a green puppet named Seymore who sang and joked. Each episode had a moral, with songs about honesty and sharing. The show also had a strange segment called ""Hot Fudge Holey Moley"" with odd music and actions.",1
"The author, a former hippie, has seen the play ""Hair"" multiple times, owns two versions of the music, and has read the script many times. They believe that while the songs are well-sung and the production values are good, the movie adaptation is terrible because it distorts the original intent of the play. The characters are portrayed as selfish and not representative of the love generation. The author also criticizes the movie for wasting spiritual moments and ruining beautiful songs. They were disappointed with the movie in 1979 and still dislike it now.",0
"The early independent film by John Cassavetes, watched on August 26, 2001, introduced a unique style and tackled taboo subjects such as racism. The movie's open-ended conclusion encourages viewers to think about the characters and their future. The film follows the lives of people, including a couple of different skin colors, and explores the consequences of their brief relationship. The improvisational acting adds to the movie's appeal. Overall, it is a must-watch classic.",1
"Project A II is a typical Jackie Chan film with expected kung fu, stunts, and humor. Although not as good as the prequel, it is still enjoyable for those seeking a fun movie. The plot is straightforward, featuring Chan battling against villains. It is recommended for those seeking an easy-to-follow movie.",1
"In the TV special, Jon is a lonely person who takes Garfield to a self-help group to meet people. He struggles to find a girlfriend until he meets a girl who is as much of a jerk as he is. Garfield is worried that Jon will forget about him, but Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats. The special has better animation than previous episodes and feels like an extended episode of Garfield and Friends.",1
I watched a documentary on HBO about the murder of an elderly tourist in Florida and was surprised to find it engaging. It won an Oscar in 2002 and is a moving portrayal of our society's progress. It's worth watching and may bring you to tears.,1
"The writer questions why the fourth movie in the series was made, as it does not follow the same storyline as the previous films and kills off a beloved character. The new cast is uninteresting and it takes too long for the hero, Charlie, to appear. The movie is mean-spirited and lacks the humor of the previous films. The writer gives it a one-star rating.",0
"Maureen O'Hara is beautiful and plays a terminally ill actress in a film that is similar to ""Love Story."" The supporting cast is good, but the plot feels contrived and insincere. O'Hara's performance is moving, but the film feels manipulative.",0
The movie featuring Himesh is poorly executed and his singing talent is questionable. The action scenes are comical and the storyline is hypocritical. The use of lyrics and musical scores is strange and the casting choices are questionable. The only redeeming quality is the portrayal of Germany. Mallika Sherawat's appearance is convenient and her performance is lackluster.,0
"This show is the worst on Nick@Night, lacking cleverness, good jokes, and style. It should have been canceled earlier and does not deserve to be played alongside great classic shows like Fresh Prince of Bel-air and George Lopez.",0
"Although I enjoyed the movie, it wasn't great. The plot and humor were mediocre, but the audience found it funny. It's not a high-quality film, but enjoyable if approached with the right mindset and not suitable for children.",0
"The film depicts the suffering of forced sex labor, but is criticized for its leftist agenda and ignoring the fact that most sex trade involves willing participants. The plot blames the American military for the kidnapping of women to work as sex slaves in ex Yugoslavian territory. The film includes unrealistic scenes, such as a woman being chased and raped in broad daylight without anyone noticing. The author is disappointed that such a film exists outside of Hollywood.",0
"I watched ""Passion of Mind"" hoping for an enjoyable alternate reality romance, but it turned out to be the worst one I've seen. The lack of magical realism and unappealing characters made it difficult to sit through, and the psychological explanation for the dual lives was distasteful.",0
"I am proud of the movie I shot with Halfdan Hussey, who captured our vision perfectly. The sets were well-crafted for each character and allowed for seamless transitions. The characters have great arcs and the actors gave excellent performances. Watch it and judge for yourself.",1
"I watched the movie once years ago and enjoyed it. The plot involves an opera singer who leaves her fortune to her cats, but her butler tries to get rid of them. The cats must make their way back home with the help of other animals while avoiding the butler. Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10.",1
"This western film from the 1950s, starring Randolph Scott, is subpar and lacks finesse. Some characters should be removed while others should have more screen time. The humor needs improvement. The action scenes are well-directed by De Toth, but the story's structure is flawed.",0
"The movie is not entirely bad, but the movie-in-a-movie is poorly executed. Danny Aiello and Dyan Cannon deliver decent performances, while Clotilde Courau impresses as the new girlfriend. Linda Carlson's topless scene is well done. However, the movie falls short of its goals and is not recommended.",0
"Despite the positive reception from critics and audiences, I personally found ""The Hospital"" to be dull, unappealing, and lacking in meaning. While the film does improve after the first 40 minutes, it still falls short as both a satire and a drama due to its unrealistic plot and lack of substance. The film's biggest flaw is its inconsistent tone, which even overshadows the great performance by Scott.",0
"Reba is a predictable and unintelligent show with characters that lack realism. The reviewer finds all the characters to be stupid, including the supposedly smart Keira. The show receives a rating of 2/10.",0
"This thirteen minute short film, made on a budget of only twenty dollars, hilariously parodies ""Star Wars"" with its ridiculous sound effects, poorly executed action scenes, and cheap special effects. The characters are presented in broad strokes, with notable favorites being Fluke Starbucker, Auggie ""Ben"" Doggie, and Darph Nader. The film's narrator, Paul Frees, adds to the humor with his rich and plummy voice. Overall, the film is a total hoot.",1
"The writer strongly dislikes Harmony Korrine and his work, particularly his writing. The film starts off promisingly with an interesting concept set in Paris, but ultimately fails due to Korrine's poor writing. The audience walked out during the screening, and the writer questions why independent cinema continues to fund Korrine's work.",0
"The movie portrays two people from different backgrounds who initially think they have nothing to offer each other, but eventually realize they cannot exist without each other. It highlights the importance of what people offer each other from within, which is often unexplainable and amazing. Despite societal pressures, they choose to be together, restoring faith in love.",1
"This movie is one of my best possessions, and it took me years to acquire. It was intended to be anti-drug propaganda but ends up glorifying drug use. However, the consequences of drug use are eventually shown, delivering the intended anti-drug message. The soundtrack, featuring Pink Floyd, is excellent. It is a must-see movie.",1
"This film portrays the futility of war and reflects Japanese pacifist beliefs after World War II. It shows Japanese soldiers stranded in the Philippine jungle, resorting to cannibalism and losing their humanity due to starvation. The movie is bleak and leaves the audience with a sense of despair about the worthlessness of life in modern warfare. Despite its nihilistic ending, the film is a powerful statement and recommended.",1
"This film is terrible and unrealistic, with poor writing and unlikable characters. The director's demon redneck idea is sloppy and poorly executed. It is the worst movie of the year and should not have been made.",0
"Robert Redford's skiing movie is reminiscent of Paul Newman and Steve McQueen's racing car films. The story follows Redford's character, David Chappellet, a small-town boy with Olympic aspirations who clashes with his coach, father, and teammates. The skiing scenes are well-done but lack excitement due to the familiarity of televised skiing events. Redford, Hackman, and Sparv give adequate performances, but the lack of dramatic tension and unlikable characters make it a forgettable film.",0
"The film is reminiscent of 80s horror comedy, but the genre has not improved and the low budget, bad acting, and unimpressive monsters make it not worth watching. It would have been better with a bigger budget. Don't waste your time unless you want bad Halloween makeup tips.",0
"Aparna Sen's film ""15 Park Avenue"" is a mature and moving portrayal of challenging situations, highlighting the fact that we all try to live in a make-believe world. The film captures the nuances of human relationships and the harsh truth that sometimes in trying to do the best for someone, we end up hurting their self-esteem. The acting of Konkona and Shabana is exceptional, making the film a masterpiece for those seeking food-for-thought.",1
"Initially, I expected an entertaining action series with compelling plots and performances, but I was mistaken. Despite my appreciation for Jamie Denton, the show is not worth watching unless you enjoy witnessing brutality and justifying the actions of agents under the guise of ""national security."" It serves as propaganda for the current government and promotes jingoism. After a few episodes, I found it tedious and opted to watch reruns of House Invaders on BBCAmerica instead. I would rather watch CSI and Without a Trace.",0
"The author attended a screening of a low-budget film targeted at gamers and was impressed by its tight script, tense action, and excellent character exposition. Despite its limitations, the creators pushed their sets and effects to the limit, resulting in a film that had the audience wrapped around its finger. The film received a huge standing ovation and the author is eagerly awaiting its release on TV and DVD.",1
"""Beowulf"" is an awful movie with no characters, story, or good fights. It is the worst film ever made and a waste of time. Christophe Lambert made a poor choice in accepting a role in it. Avoid watching ""Beowulf"" at all costs.",0
"This low-budget thriller, a remake of ""When Worlds Collide,"" follows eccentric scientist Peter Crawford as he builds an underground sanctuary to save a select group of people from an approaching comet. Gulf-war veteran Jake Lowe discovers the sanctuary and questions Crawford's decision to keep it hidden. The film offers interesting drama around the subject of who should live and who should die. Despite some scientific inaccuracies, the well-developed story makes it a recommended watch for fans of apocalyptic movies.",1
"The writer remembers a great Christmas movie they watched on TV at age 11 but couldn't remember the title. They discussed it with a friend but neither could recall the title. They posted about it on a TV movie website and someone helped them find it. They want to watch it again and are asking for help finding it online or a copy. They also mention a fun fact about the sister of an actor from ""A Christmas Story.""",1
"As a Harold Lloyd fan, I agree with the other reviewer's comments, except that I think ""Movie Crazy"" is his best sound film, followed closely by ""Cat's Paw."" The film is entertaining throughout, with George Barbier almost stealing the show in many scenes. It would have been nice if Una Merkel's character had been more sympathetic to Harold, but her true feelings are only revealed in the last few minutes of the film, without any romance. Overall, it's a must-see film.",1
"The movie ""Hell Ride"" directed, written, and starring Larry Bishop is a disappointment with a dull plot, uninteresting characters, and terrible dialogue. The film lacks action and humor, and even fans of trashy biker movies will feel cheated. It is recommended to watch the real stuff instead.",0
"Four years after 9/11, most people remember the planes crashing, the collapse of the twin towers, and the acts of terrorism and heroism. However, the memories are not personal for most of us. A new film offers a chance for everyone to understand the personal losses of that day and should be watched.",1
"This Star Trek film is weak due to a poor script and budget constraints, resulting in a mishandled finale. The directing is not as bad as commonly believed, but the characters act out of style from the previous films. Lawrence Luckinbull is convincing as a renegade Vulcan with mystical powers, but these scenes do not advance the plot. The score is great and there are funny scenes, but the plot holes and attempts at humor are embarrassing. Despite its flaws, the film has its moments.",0
"The short film Boy and a Bicycle, found on the DVD for Ridley Scott's The Duellists, lacks the director's signature style and features a boy aimlessly riding a bike with confusing dialogue. Despite its lack of quality, fans of Ridley Scott should still watch it.",0
"Nu produces a few thrilling movies each year, including Shadowcaster III, which features Frank Zagarino as an almost indestructible and schizophrenic android. The plot is not revealed to avoid spoiling the laughs. The movie received a 2/10 rating, but the technicians who worked on it deserve recognition for their hard work.",0
"The movie was average in terms of acting, camera usage, and plot, but could have been better if it had a faster pace and delved deeper into the characters' backgrounds. The flashbacks of Alice's home life were not compelling enough, and the lack of insight into the couple's lives was disappointing. The movie's plot was not as interesting as it could have been, and the Boston/New England accent seemed forced. Overall, the movie is not worth watching and the award it won at Sundance was likely due to weak competition.",0
"A group of young people play a video game called Stay Alive after the death of their friend Loomis, but they soon realize a connection between the game and Loomis' death. The film is a low-budget PG-13 horror aimed at cashing in on the junior high school crowd, with sloppy direction, bad dialogue, and a plot full of holes. The idea had promise, but the poor execution makes it a dud. Brainscan is a superior alternative.",0
"The film ""Choose Conner"" is a lesser-known drama about a young politician who influences a 15-year-old boy, with a vague plot that leaves much to the audience's interpretation. The cast, including Steven Weber, Alex D. Linz, and Escher Holloway, deliver convincing performances. The film was directed and written by Luke Eberl, who was under 23 years old at the time and received positive ratings.",1
"Closet Land is a poorly made film that features excellent actors and depicts the unending abuse of a woman prisoner by a sadistic police official in a minimalist, fantasy futuristic setting. The film lacks context and depth, and its pornographic aspects are justified as a warning against totalitarian government, but ultimately it fails to provide any meaningful insight or message.",0
"The movie is enjoyable and has both humorous and emotional moments. The title, ""Driving Lessons,"" may be misleading as it is not the main focus of the film. The actors, especially Julie, are great and the story reveals secrets about the characters.",1
"Although the plot was predictable and clichéd, the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance in the well-executed sequences made the movie enjoyable. The music was also good and the lead actors were decent, but the dancing was impressive. It's a movie worth watching for the dance sequences and is much better than ""You Got Served"" in terms of plot and drama.",0
"Father Hood is a comedic film about a criminal named Jack Charles, played by Patrick Swayze, who kidnaps his son with the help of his daughter, Kathleen Charles, played by Sabrina Lloyd. The three embark on a cross-country adventure while being pursued by Kathleen Mercer, a reporter investigating the foster care system, and Rita, Jack's con-artist mother. Despite his initial reluctance, Jack grows attached to his children and becomes more optimistic throughout the film.",1
"The movie Judge and Jury started off promising with a thrilling chase scene, but became increasingly foolish. Despite David Keith's strong performance, the film was a disappointment and a waste of his talent. The reviewer gave it a 3 out of 5, with one extra star for the cool gun.",0
"The movie is not as good as Pam Grier's other films, with a predictable plot, poor dialogue, and some bad acting. However, the scene near the end where Grier wears a sexy blue wetsuit is worth watching. Grier is a talented and beautiful actress, and it's nice to see her showcased in a tight wetsuit. Rent the DVD and see for yourself.",1
"Initially worried my understanding of movies and life was different from everyone else's due to positive reviews, I am now relieved that later reviews have turned sour. The movie's characters, dialogue, soundtrack, narration, and overall tone felt false and heavy-handed, with scenes that did not reflect reality. The movie seemed to bully viewers into liking it due to its Seriousness and focus on Real People and Issues, but it did not work for me.",0
"The 1980's low budget horror film ""One Dark Night"" is a classic with retro elements that transport viewers to a simpler time. The film tells a straightforward story of the consequences of meddling with the dead, with well-acted performances and direction by Tom McLoughlin. While lacking in special effects towards the end, it is a perfect choice for fans of 80's horror or those seeking a fun night of classic horror.",1
"""Boogie Nights"" is a remarkable film with exceptional direction and a talented cast delivering outstanding performances. Despite its controversial subject matter, the movie is handled with great care and has an unexpected emotional impact that lingers long after it ends.""",1
"The movie Crackerjack is popular among lawn bowlers for its relatable humor, including scenes such as the wheel of cheese, the loud speaker, and Jack's beer-cracking moment. Non-bowlers may not find it as enjoyable. The Evans Head Bowlo is highly recommended for its friendly atmosphere.",1
"The show started off interesting, showing the challenges of crab fishing, but later became focused on the drama of the fishermen's lives. Episodes are repetitive and lack variety. The show should be renamed ""Crab Boat Drama"" or be a one-time segment on another show. The Discovery Channel should have learned from the mistakes made with American Choppers.",0
"The Cameron Mitchell turkey is a strange movie about an actor/makeup man who is disfigured by a studio head and ends up working at a wax museum where he kidnaps and kills people to turn them into displays. The movie is bizarre and captivating, with wax figures that don't move and a plot that gets increasingly weird. It's a classic bad movie that will leave a lasting impression.",0
"A friend recommended a movie with impressive fighting scenes, but there wasn't enough fighting. The plot revolves around a love triangle between Tae-sung, Hea-won, and Han-kyung, who discovers Tae-sung is her brother. The movie is good but depressing, and similar to other Korean movies about fighting, death, and incest. Be prepared to cry at the end.",1
"The film ""Hail The Woman"" is a moving masterpiece, but the only surviving print is badly scratched, making it difficult for most people to watch. The film's theme of spiritual restoration before Christ of the family unit is not politically correct, but it remains a powerful theme for those struggling with broken family relationships. The cast, including Florence Vidor, Madge Bellamy, Theodore Roberts, and Lloyd Hughes, is magnificent. Despite its deterioration, the film is worth watching in its entirety, especially during Christmas.",1
"The writer enjoyed the movie ""Hitch"" and was impressed by both their own choice of film and the quality of the movie itself. The story follows a matchmaker named Hitch who helps a man woo a woman, while also pursuing a woman himself. The two storylines intersect and create humorous moments. The movie is well-paced and enjoyable.",1
"This movie is not for gore lovers, as it has little blood and guts. It is similar to Open Water but with likable characters who we care about when they are in danger. The scares are creative and the movie stays realistic without becoming annoying. The true story that inspired the movie had a more gruesome ending, with the crocodile taunting the survivors with the dead body of their friend.",1
"Although not yet released in the U.S., this enjoyable comedy depicts the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small British town. The characters are memorable and the acting is great, making it a movie worth seeking out despite being overshadowed by blockbusters.",1
"Hardware Wars, a 20-minute parody classic, has been released on DVD. It is a staple in low budget film production classes and has additional material showcasing the Fosselius wit, including a dead-on parody called Antique Sideshow. The Director's Commentary and Creature Feature are also hysterical. The author hopes to see Ernie F. and crew take on contemporary overblown and overbudgeted targets to parody.",1
"The film is moving and inspiring, making you feel like part of the family and grateful for life during the depression era. Jonathan Silverman's performance is convincing and witty, making it a must-see for teens.",1
"""I Was A Communist For The FBI"" is a film that tells the story of an FBI undercover agent named Matt Cvetic who infiltrated the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and reported on their activities to his handlers in the FBI. Despite being nominated for an Oscar in the documentary category, the film is not a documentary and is rather exploitive. The film is a testament to the paranoid times of the past, and there are few objective works on film or in print about the Communist Party of the USA.",0
"In Russia, Geralt of Rivia is a beloved character created by the talented writer Andrzej Sapkowski. The RPG game ""Witcher"" is a great example of how amazing material can be brought to life. However, the movie ""Vedmak\Wiedzmin"" failed due to a lack of budget, directing, and a good script. Despite this, there is still hope for a new and better movie adaptation in the future.",0
"I went to see ""Everything is Illuminated"" without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The film, directed by Leiv Schreiber, follows a man on a journey through the past with an eccentric group. The first half is funny and European, while the second half is somber and about the holocaust. The movie is emotional, with powerful acting and beautiful cinematography. It captured my heart with its touching scenes and is more than just a story of illumination, but also of relationships and connections.",1
"The Twilight Zone had great and terrible episodes, with some in between. Despite being an attack on Fidel Castro, the episode with a lookalike and a magic mirror is preachy and silly, making audiences laugh at American efforts to marginalize Castro. It is almost laughably bad when seen today.",0
"While I have criticized Americans for their lack of comedic writing, they have never produced anything as bad as the worst British comedy show, which ranks second only to ""Are You Being Served"" on my scale of terrible English language comedies. This show, along with others from that time, relied on ridiculous situations and catchphrases to entertain audiences. Despite Michael Crawford's talent, I would rather watch ""Rhoda"" for a month than endure a single episode of this shameful show.",0
"The movies Alien and Predator revolutionized the creature feature genre, but The Cave fails to improve upon it with its clichéd plot and unexciting characters. The action is dull and lacks gore, and the special effects are well done but not original. The directorial debut of Bruce Hunt is a huge mistake, and almost everything about the movie stinks. Only forgiving moviegoers will find it forgivable.",0
"Despite hoping for a gritty portrayal of Brighton reminiscent of Graham Greene, Mockney fails to deliver. The characters are cliché and the film looks more like a TV series than a movie. Famke Janssen's performance is too polished for the film and the acting is lackluster. The film is boring and receives a 3/10 rating.",0
"No Holds Barred is a terrible movie that should not be taken seriously. It is similar to Plan 9 From Outer Space in that it is so bad it's funny. The funniest moments are often unintentional, such as when Rip grabs the limo driver. It's hard to understand how anyone thought this movie would be profitable, and the person responsible should be fired. The movie only earns a 1 out of 5, and that's just for the unintentionally funny parts.",0
"The writer enjoyed ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" for its simplicity and well-developed characters, while finding ""Hero"" to be pretentious and demanding with a horrible moral. They do not recommend it.",0
"Despite Michael Jackson being a low point and the special effects being subpar, it's important to remember that this was not a high-budget film like Harry Potter or Star Wars. Overall, the movie was amusing and worth watching, with some weaknesses. Parodies are enjoyable regardless of budget. Angela believes it's a decent movie.",1
"Mistakenly watched a film, thought it was a different one. Regret wasting an hour on it, disliked it and couldn't finish it. Disgusted by the poor script and bad acting, gave it a 1-star rating. Believes an amateur could make a better movie.",0
"Although the movie is bad, it is entertaining to watch if you go into it knowing it's bad. The special effects, animals, and acting are all poor, but the actors' attempts at fear are amusing. The protagonist's lack of reaction to his sister's danger is disappointing, and he eventually joins her in the belly of a komodo dragon.",0
"After enjoying it on Thames television, I purchased and loved it so much that I bought another copy. Unfortunately, it is not available on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD, but the Australian version is good. I may even buy another copy.",1
"Antonioni and Wim Wenders are among the top filmmakers, known for their exceptional storytelling, characters, and visuals. Their work is not intended for children. This film is a must-see for its brilliance.",1
"The second game is similar to the first but with new levels and features. The Dreamcast version is the best with better graphics and more detailed skaters. The levels are well-designed and enjoyable, with a focus on length rather than graphics. Overall, it's a great game and worth playing.",1
"The movie Lay it Down disappoints on many levels, particularly due to the impersonal acting. While Christians may agree with the message, the movie fails to deliver as a witnessing tool. The director's commentary reveals his pedantic understanding of non-Christians and his satisfaction with rushed editing and overused transitions. The movie includes symbolic motifs, but also includes insensitive comments about suicide and a lack of professionalism. Despite its flaws, the movie was made on a low budget and tight time limit, earning a score of 2/10 instead of 1/10.",0
"Rebecca Cammisa, the co-creator of the film, discussed her open and uninhibited style of filmmaking at the 2002 High Falls Film Festival. Despite being constrained in the small group home, the film was expertly shot with a realistic approach. Sister Helen, the main character, is a remarkable combination of caring, tough, and street smart, with her past being introduced in a few carefully selected minutes throughout the film. Overall, the film is a treasure of cinema and humanity.",1
"The film attempts to adapt the classic Odyssey story to a 1930s setting with escaped convicts as the adventurers. The music soundtrack is the film's greatest strength, effectively evoking the era and spiritual references. However, the characters are unlikable and lack positive qualities, making it hard to relate to them. The movie takes the characters on an ""odyssey"" encountering symbolic and mystical characters, but offensive stereotypes and mindless violence detract from the intellectual nature of the original source material. Other adaptations of the Odyssey are better, and the soundtrack is worth buying.",0
"Monogram Studios produced cheap but entertaining movies designed to be shown at the bottom of a double bill. Their films were coarse, fast, and vulgar, but exhilarating. ""Flight to Mars"" is a well-funded example of a Monogram movie, shot in five days and in color. The plot is predictable, the special effects are not special, and the acting is pedestrian. However, dedicated fans of Monogram productions should enjoy it.",0
"Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon's acting in the movie is relatable to most families. Natalie's performance is exceptional and deserving of a Golden Globe nomination, while Susan's professionalism shines through in her unique role. The film is a must-see for both Natalie's fans and those seeking an emotional experience.",1
"A wealthy young man, raised as a god's son, struggles with his Chinese heritage in a predominantly white world. Despite the unrealistic premise and a far-fetched plot twist, the film offers decent entertainment and strong acting performances. Richard Barthelmess delivers a serious portrayal of the protagonist, while Constance Bennett's character is not particularly likable. Frank Albertson has a small role, and other notable actors include E. Alyn Warren, Anders Randolf, and Claude King. The original Technicolor has faded, and one shot is likely filmed on Santa Catalina Island.",1
"The movie's plot is unoriginal and clearly copied from Jurassic Park, with no attempt to conceal it. The low budget resulted in poorly made dinosaur toys that move unnaturally, and the acting is equally stiff. The last half hour is particularly dull, making it difficult to stay awake. The only positive aspect is that it doesn't last the full 90 minutes.",0
"The low-budget Christian film has average acting and a long-winded message, but is saved by some nice cars and a dramatic fight scene. It is best viewed on a big screen and receives a 7/10 rating.",1
"I strongly disagree with those who criticize this movie. It was one of my favorites at the Stockholm film festival. The use of dolls in horror movies is not new, but it was well executed in this film. The atmosphere, setting, actors, and camera work were all excellent. It's not like The Grudge or The Ring, but it's perfect for a stylized scare. Although it's predictable and sometimes laughable, I recommend it to horror fans.",1
"Zac Efron's role in 'The Suite Life of Zack and Cody' is appreciated by the writer, who considers it their favorite show. The writer admires the humor and the cast, including their favorite actors from 'High School Musical'. They possess an autographed picture of Zac Efron and a personalized 'High School Musical' mug.",1
"The movie exceeded my expectations and had humorous moments, featuring a fresh storyline.",1
This 90's version of a forgotten 70's show lacks plot and has poor wardrobe. The storyline of a small man chasing down a larger one is unbelievable. It is not recommended for anyone over 12 years old. The author walked out of the theater and received a refund.,0
"K-PAX is a genre-bending movie about a mental hospital patient named Prot who claims to be from a distant planet. The film combines drama, science-fiction, fantasy, and comedy, with a great soundtrack and strong performances from Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. The movie is rated PG-13 for some violent images, brief language, and sensuality, but overall it is an enjoyable and well-done film that offers some good twists and turns. The DVD includes plenty of extras, including an alternate ending and deleted scenes.",1
"The movie title ""Stupid Teenagers Must Die"" initially seemed like a spoof, but the original title was ""Blood and Guts"". However, the movie fails to be either a spoof or a serious splatter movie. The plot is unoriginal and poorly executed, with grainy visuals and unrealistic characters. The young cast is decent, but the director lacks direction and the sound quality is inconsistent. Overall, it is a bad horror movie with a rating of 3 out of 10.",0
The author is disappointed with the film as it does not accurately depict the town of Rennes or the Celtic legends of Brittany. The film lacks originality and has a weak plot and characters. The author suggests avoiding it.,0
"Initially dismissed as exaggerated, ""The China Syndrome"" gained credibility after the Three Mile Island accident. The film critiques public utilities and TV news, particularly the ""Happy Talk"" format. Despite a few technical errors, the film raises important questions about nuclear power and its potential dangers, making it as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago.",1
"""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" is a fantastic movie that must be watched, featuring amazing performances by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, a great plot, and incredible action scenes. I rate it a perfect 10, A+, and 4 stars.",1
"Despite my initial excitement to see Lawrence's stand-up, I regretted watching it as it felt like a motivational speech in hell with crude jokes about sex and sexual organs. Lawrence lacked the ability to elevate the humor like Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior, or Robin Williams. The only time I found it funny was when he talked about his experience with the law and recovery in the hospital. Overall, I would give it negative points if possible.",0
"Critics have dubbed it the ""Oscar Winner club"" due to the trend of actors winning Oscars and then starring in poorly received films. Charlize Theron's performance in Æon Flux is praised, but the film itself is criticized for its shallow plot, dull action, and poor special effects. The story is set in a totalitarian state where the citizens are unable to reproduce, and Æon Flux is an assassin fighting for justice and freedom. The film is compared to an unrealistic video game and is deemed unworthy of a franchise. The acting is wooden and emotionless, and the film fails to capture the essence of the original cartoon. It is advised to avoid the film.",0
"Breaking Dawn is a psychological horror thriller about a college student named Eve who is assigned to study a convicted killer named Don Wake. As she tries to figure him out, she begins to see a dark shadowy figure and loses her grip on reality. However, the twist ending ruins the entire film and makes everything that came before it irrelevant. The director fails to tie together the absurdities in the script and the acting is decent but not enough to save the film. Breaking Dawn is a waste of time and should be avoided.",0
"The movie features a wrestler who cannot act, with terrible action and acting. The plot is stupid, with criminals placed in a hotel and randomly killed off. The only redeeming quality is the unique death of the villain. Overall, it is a waste of time and one of the worst movies seen.",0
"The movie is about a group of small town teens who rob a local bank to finance their dreams. Brian, who wants to attend art school, is offered the role of distracting the guard. When the Sheriff and his force surround the bank, tensions rise and the teens turn on each other, leading to a gruesome and intense paper cutter scene.",1
"The movie Michael is a humorous and lighthearted film that doesn't require a detailed plot summary. It features a great premise and takes the audience on an enjoyable road trip. John Travolta's portrayal of a chain-smoking, lady-loving, bar-brawling, pie-eating angel is spot-on and the character Sparky is also lovable. It's a recommended watch for those looking for a good time and some laughs.",1
"The movie lacks a coherent plot, with a storyline about a guy moving in with his grandma and redeeming himself being introduced only at the end. The climax of the movie, a big pot party at grandma's house, is unrelated to the supposed plot. Despite this, the movie is funny and relies heavily on jokes. Some of the jokes include ""Her pussy smells like the great depression,"" ""He just sucked his first titty...yeah for 13 hours,"" and ""It's for you...i think it's the Devil.""",0
"Sammi Cheng and Andy Lau star in their third film together, ""Yesterday Once More,"" directed by Johnnie To. However, fans of To's action films will be disappointed as there are no guns used in the film. Additionally, fans of Cheng and Lau's previous films will also be disappointed as ""Yesterday Once More"" is not as funny or endearing. The film follows a divorced couple, both professional thieves, who are suspected of stealing a priceless ruby necklace. The movie is not about two people falling in love but rather about two people who have always been in love but let pride and greed overwhelm them. Overall, the film falls short of expectations with terrible writing, ridiculous situations, and unnecessary subplots and supporting characters.",0
"I bought an early Chuck Norris DVD, but the geography in the movie was inaccurate. Despite this, it's still an enjoyable watch.",0
"The film is divisive, with people either loving or hating it. The movie is inspired by Kafka's America, and both it and Oh Lucky Man use Brechtian techniques to convey their messages. However, while Oh Lucky Man uses these techniques to show the absurdity of life and class systems, Weekend uses them to force its ideological message on the audience. The film is entirely about the director's message, with unpleasant scenes and long speeches directed at the camera. The contrast between the explicit threesome and the comical rape destroys the film's faith in itself and its characters. The reviewer suggests watching Oh Lucky Man instead, as it is a work of genius, while Weekend is a work of pretension.",0
"The movie is about a mysterious love letter and features a talented cast including Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck, and Ellen DeGeneres. However, the plot is considered foolish, with unrealistic character choices such as Capshaw's character choosing an immature college student over Selleck's character who is in love with her. The movie also includes unrealistic scenes, such as Capshaw's jogging. Overall, the movie is considered dopey.",0
"The Law & Order and CSI franchises would be no match for Dolomite's soul-shivering kicks. Rudy Ray Moore, who came from the gutbucket nightclub scene, created the character of Dolomite as a mix of bold Black badasses. Despite his middle-aged, blubbery appearance, he maintained a loyal stable of kung fu wenches. The low-budget, enthusiastic acting in the movie is a fun and dumb tribute to a legendary performer.",1
"'Hoppity Goes To Town' is a charming and timeless animated movie from 1941 that the author has a soft spot for. They recently watched it on TV and found it just as delightful as they remembered, with a lovely moral tale that appeals to both parents and children. The film has a nice running time for kids and a simple yet involving storyline, making it a classic that could be successfully remade in CGI.",1
"The biopic of Ed Wood, directed by Tim Burton, paid homage to the enthusiastic but untalented filmmaker. Plan 9 was entertaining despite its flaws, but the portrayal of cross-dressing in this film is cartoonish and self-parodying. The film has conflicting messages about tolerance and portrays transvestism as a disease. The entertainment value is low, and the rape scene seems to be included for shock value. While the film may have been brave for mentioning transvestites in the 50s, it ultimately fails to advocate for anything meaningful.",0
"Despite my initial expectations and appreciation for foreign films and beautiful cinematography, I found this movie to be lacking in plot and overly long, resulting in a tedious viewing experience.",0
"The movie has many references to other films, which can be distracting, but it is still worth watching due to the strong performances by Costner and Kutcher. The supporting cast is also good, but some characters are overused. Overall, the movie is enjoyable but not without flaws. It receives a rating of 7 out of 10, but almost a 6.",1
"Foolish hikers encounter a murderous gypsy in the Utah mountains in the slasher film, The Prey. While it lacks imagination and features unlikable victim characters, it has some spooky moments and a decent music score. However, there are better films in the genre, making it only watchable for die-hard slasher fans. It receives a rating of 1.5 out of 4 stars.",0
"Mickey Rooney plays a young man who meets Elizabeth Taylor, a 12-year-old girl who loves horses. Taylor takes Rooney home and they are supported by her family. The plot of ""National Velvet"" is unrealistic, but the characters' connection to horses and each other is well-conceived. Rooney and Taylor give excellent performances, and the film is enhanced by fine direction, photography, and editing. It is a sentimental classic.",1
"It feels like exploring a museum and admiring the impressive skills of Michael Cimino, the main composer, and Vilmos Zsigmond, the talented light art designer. The experience is heavenly, discovering the intricate details applied to each frame. This film is undoubtedly one of the finest.",1
"During the Civil War, a wounded Union soldier seeks refuge in a Confederate ladies' school where the head mistress and teacher care for him. However, tensions arise between the sexually frustrated women and the soldier takes advantage of the situation. The film, directed by Don Siegel and starring Clint Eastwood, is a stylish and hauntingly dark portrayal of sexual depravity. The performances are commendable, particularly Geraldine Page as the head mistress. The film has a perversely dark sense of humor and layers of intrigue, making it more than just a basic shocker.",1
"This movie is a terrible combination of 'Take Fame' and 'You've Got Served', aimed at uninteresting teenagers. The story is similar to 'You've Got Served', following three African-American teens living in Baltimore who struggle in school and dance in old buildings. They steal cars to afford their hip-hop clothing, but one of them gets caught and forced to clean the school. He meets a white student and discovers his Irish-American heritage, causing tension with his friends. The movie ends with a dramatic finale despite the tragic death of one of the characters.",0
"The film ""K-PAX,"" directed by Iain Softley and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges, explores the possibility of an individual claiming to be from a distant planet. Dr. Mark Powell attempts to uncover the truth about his patient, Prot, who remains convincing despite intense probing. The film challenges the viewer to reflect on their own concepts of what is possible and creates an atmosphere of wonder. Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Prot, while Jeff Bridges infuses Powell with an underlying complexity. The film is a dissertation on possibilities and an examination of the complexities of the human condition.",1
"This obscure western film features stunning colors reminiscent of ""Johnny Guitar"" and surreal scenes with unusual characters and action. Although not a masterpiece, it deserves more recognition in western encyclopedias.",1
"The movie was a waste of time except for the attractive lead actor. The special effects were not impressive and the performance of another actor was disappointing. However, it was discovered that someone on the Lord of the Rings production crew made home movies.",0
"The show was corny and terrible, and it was no surprise that it didn't last long. Even Tales From the Crypt tried to make use of the corny episodes, but they were not scary. The bad acting and music made it even worse, and it's a relief that the show never returned.",0
"Steven Seagal's latest movie, The Foreigner, is a complete disappointment with a poorly written script, bad direction, and cheesy music. The action sequences are not worth watching and the movie only gets worse as it progresses. The only positive aspect is its short running time. In short, it is advised to stay away from this movie.",0
"""Paranormal State"" is a show that appeals to believers in the paranormal, but it is entirely staged with scripted storylines. While they visit real haunted locations and speak with witnesses, it feels more like a fictional movie than a non-fictional show. It is not recommended unless you are seeking a basic scare, and ""Ghost Hunters"" is a better option.",0
"This movie is a great comedy that explores mid-life crises, the struggles of unrecognized gay unions, and societal differences. It stars Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett and features a fantastic character in Maudie. Fans of Tales of the City will enjoy this quirky film.",1
MAKING LOVE was a groundbreaking film in 1982 for its portrayal of a romantic love story between two men. LATTER DAYS is a melodramatic but wonderful romantic movie that addresses the issue of religion and rejection faced by gay people. The movie blends fantasy and reality and is unforgettable. It's about time for a good romance between two men.,1
"Despite being labeled as a B movie, this well-written and well-acted comedy starring Red Skelton as The Fox and Ann Rutherford as his fiance is highly entertaining. The gang of criminals, led by Conrad Veidt, is also well-cast. Directed by S. Sylvan Simon, not Vincente Minelli, this film is a great example of the imaginative movies of its time. Don't let your black and white prejudice stop you from enjoying this classic comedy, which also happens to be Red Skelton's first starring role. Keep an ear out for the reference to Orson Welles' War of the Worlds broadcast during the climax.",1
"The Karate Kid franchise should have ended after the first movie, but the producer convinced the actors to make a trilogy. The Next Karate Kid features a new protagonist, Julie Pierce, played by Hilary Swank, who has family and school problems. She falls for a nice guy who is one of her gym teacher's students, which gets her into more trouble. Mr. Miyagi is back to help her fight the bad guys. The movie is full of clichés and is a dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. There is one beautiful sequence involving Asian monks dancing to pop music, but it's not enough to recommend the rest of the film.",0
"This early-talkie melodrama, despite claims, has little in common with ""Citizen Kane"". It's a biopic of a fictional plutocrat told in flashback, with a young Spencer Tracy showing depth and authority. The scriptwriter, Preston Sturges, doesn't show his later gift for sparkling dialog, and there are some plot holes and missing audio snippets in the surviving print. However, it's still very watchable, with Colleen Moore playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man and Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history.",1
"The characters were strong and believable, with David Boreanaz impressing in a comedic role. The first part was light and funny, but the blackmail plot was surreal and the rest of the film was disappointing. The lack of consequences for two of the girls was frustrating, but overall it was an interesting movie.",1
"This low-budget film noir about a policeman seeking revenge for his father's death falls into the category of meandering and uninteresting movies. Despite the promise of a fascinating jukebox and a beautiful young Anne Jeffreys in a small role, the film fails to deliver.",0
"'Summer in the City' is a unique film that combines different styles and genres, directed by Niami. The film's success is due to its diverse and interesting characters, portrayed by a talented cast including Bai Ling, Ornella Muti, Robert Burke, and Peter Stormare. The soundtrack by John Cale is also a great addition.",1
"The Dad's Army movie is funny but not as catchy as the TV and radio series. It's a good introduction for those who haven't seen it before, but fans won't find anything new. The movie has better quality than the BBC recordings, but the holdup sequence is considered lame.",1
"After watching a documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, the author compared it to the movie they had just seen and found it to be weak in every aspect, including acting, editing, music, story, and character development. The movie also tried to shock with explicit cursing, but it was not effective. The author gave it a rating of 2/10.",0
"This is a good movie for young music enthusiasts interested in street kids and famous musicians. It features the great violinist Heifitz and talented child actors, making it a solid family film from the late 1930s. While not the best of 1939, it's a pleasant option for a rainy day with AMC or a video rental store.",1
"Initially, eXistenZ seemed strange with organic pods connecting players to a virtual reality game. However, the film's twists and weirdness kept it entertaining with a great open ending. Security personnel use bone guns instead of metal detectors.",1
"The film has its pretentious moments but also has moments of deep beauty and humor. The segments are rated individually, with some being better than others. The best segments are ""Armide,"" ""Liebestod,"" and ""Nessun dorma."" Overall, the film is given a solid 7/10 rating and is not as bad as it has been made out to be.",1
"After hearing legends about the film, the writer impatiently watched it but had to fast forward through some of the most nonsensical scenes. They consider it the worst film they've ever seen, with a revoltingly bad plot, acting, directing, and sets. The writer believes only drug junkies with burned-out brains would enjoy it and wishes it would join ""Superbabies"" on IMDb's rating. Fortunately, it is obscure and unlikely to receive many ""1"" votes.",0
"Robert Carlyle delivers another outstanding performance in this well-captured period piece. Despite some initial discomfort with the modern techno soundtrack, it ultimately proves to be a well-chosen addition. Highly recommended.",1
"Todd Sheets' low budget Zombie movie, Zombie Bloodbath 2, has a great story, impressive gore, and wicked psychos, but is hindered by its weak dialogue and slow imaging. Despite these flaws, the movie delivers on the essential elements of a Zombie movie, including gore, a good plot, and a fast-paced adventure into the macabre. With a larger budget, Sheets could have created a movie that outdoes even Dawn of the Dead. As Sheets improves and earns more money, he continues to craft his vision better. Zombie Bloodbath 2 is just one of his stepping stones to success.",1
"Lost's season two finale surpasses the intensity and heartbreak of season one's finale. Locke's lack of faith has tragic consequences for the castaways, while Michael's betrayal may result in his death if he doesn't escape the island. The finale raises more questions than the previous one, and the reviewer is eagerly anticipating the next season. The current review on the page is a poorly constructed spoiler fest that ruins the surprise for others.",1
"This movie is not original and filled with clichés from 90's movies. Despite a few cheap laughs, it is predictable and boring. The cast is talented but it is shocking they signed on for this piece of junk. The movie is so bad that the reviewer could not finish watching it and would pay someone not to watch it.",0
"Despite initially bringing home the wrong DVD, the author was pleasantly surprised by the film ""The Intruder"". The movie follows two sisters on separate journeys through post-student demo Europe in the 1970s, and is beautifully shot in various European cities. The story is emotionally complex and well-acted, and is recommended for those looking for a refined and tasteful film. It is not recommended for fans of action movies like ""Commando"".",1
"This Australian adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth is violent and contains nudity, making it unsuitable for some viewers. Despite some good acting, the low-budget production lacks compelling storytelling and only works sporadically. While it may appeal to Shakespeare fans, those looking for a high-quality film may be disappointed.",0
"I watched A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL) with English subtitles, which was 137 minutes long. Initially, I found the film confusing and uninteresting, but it became more engaging when the focus shifted to a young girl who was adopted and searching for her biological mother in war-torn Sri Lanka. Despite some flaws, the film was emotionally impactful and featured typical Indian-style songs.",1
"The movie is not rated as awful because of the excellent acting by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. Lupino's character is distressed while trying to escape a madman, and Ryan's character is terrifying as he changes from being simple to threatening. The house Lupino's character lives in is a fire-trap, and she is unable to get out or summon help. The movie contains anachronistic elements, and it is recommended to watch for these oddities.",0
"Initially skeptical about the show Greek, as a member of a sorority, I was pleasantly surprised to find it humorous without being derogatory towards Greek organizations. The characters are mostly likable, with the exception of Rebecca Logan, and the chemistry between Casey and Rusty is enjoyable. Cappie's character adds depth to the show, and Rusty's roommate Dale, played by Clark Duke, is also funny. Overall, it's an enjoyable show and I'm excited for season 2.",1
"As a 15-year-old, I enjoyed this movie and related to Ann August's loneliness. The acting, particularly by Natalie and Susan, was exceptional and their chemistry brought the characters to life. I recommend this movie to anyone looking to escape and suggest watching it with a friend or mother to enhance the emotional experience.",1
"Walter Hill's action movie, despite its well-established characters and setting, falls short due to lackluster performances from Ice-T and Cube. The plot twists are nonsensical and lead nowhere, leaving the viewer confused. However, there are a few enjoyable moments, such as a scene with a needle and William Sadler's large pistol. Overall, the movie is comparable to Domino's pizza - it's edible but not satisfying.",0
"The movie is about a secret service agent who was assigned to protect JFK on the day of his assassination and is haunted by it. Thirty years later, he loses his partner while trying to stop another assassination attempt. The movie has a great score and a restrained romance between Russo and Eastwood. Malchovich's performance is great and the movie is highly recommended.",1
"The film, which was Hitchcock's first attempt at a plot he later re-shot, features memorable supporting characters that overshadow the wooden lead actors. Hitchcock himself performs two extraordinary stunts in the film, which carries an anti-fascist message but emphasizes action over politics. Despite the lack of realistic special effects, attempting to convey the director's vision is an impressive achievement. The film is worth watching, particularly for the supporting roles.",1
"This thrilling film relies on situation rather than action, similar to The Day of the Jackal. The acting is superb, with Aidan Quinn playing a double role and Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley also delivering strong performances. Despite minimal action, the film is tense and effective, with a slow set-up leading to a breathless second half. It's a tight and gripping film that should not be missed.",1
"The episode ""Etude In Black"" of Columbo is highly praised and considered to be more than 90% perfect, with Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes, and Peter Falk delivering standout performances. The plot involves a famous conductor, Alex Benedict, who murders his young lover to avoid destroying his career and marriage. Columbo quickly realizes that it was homicide and connects Alex to the victim, but it takes a while to find the vital piece of evidence. The episode features top-notch extra characters and a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy films. The sledgehammer view of classical music loses the show a couple of small points, but the music is good, dramatic, and exciting. The deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes are evident in the quality of the episode.",1
"This film is based on the true story of the FBI's search for the perpetrators of the World Trade Center bombing and explores their use of informants. It suggests that the tragedy could have been prevented. Overall, it is a highly recommended movie.",1
"The film about Jefferson was disappointing, with too much focus on his relationship with Cosway and poor acting by Thandie Newton as Sally Hemmings. The script lacked energy and excitement, and Nolte's accent made Jefferson sound ignorant. The film was too long and underdeveloped in exploring Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings on slavery. However, the costumes were beautiful and Greta Scacchi played Cosway well. A better film to watch about the revolutionary era and/or Jefferson is 1776.",0
"My roommate and I received free tickets for a Pre Screening in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. I expected the film to be controversial or overdone, but it turned out to be a heartwarming story of two people helping each other. The film is well-balanced and doesn't take itself too seriously, which is its beauty. Although Timberlake's acting is poor, I still recommend the movie as it offers a unique experience.",1
"The title of the film accurately describes an island inhabited by fishmen. A doctor and his crew are either killed by the fishmen or forced to work for a treasure hunter who has been keeping two hostages for 15 years. The hostages' captor believes he has found Atlantis and wants the fishmen to uncover a treasure trove. The film is directed by Sergio Martino and has a fast pace, good acting, convincing fishmen, and an excellent music score.",0
"The movie is good and features famous Rome landmarks. It stars Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, and Ayelet Zurer and is from the same writer and director as The Da Vinci Code. The plot involves a race to find the Illuminati's secret meeting place in Rome. The ending has a great plot twist. It's worth watching and better than the movie 2010.",1
"Create a cliched horror movie with numerous plot holes and a poorly written script. Cast inexperienced actors with fake American accents and use low-budget special effects. Despite the poor quality, including nudity on the cover may still result in profitable sales.",0
"This Mafia movie is one of the best due to its realistic story, relatable characters, good dialogue, and realistic action scenes. It also launched the careers of Pesci and Vincent, and influenced the success of other films like Casino and Goodfellas. Overall, it receives a perfect score. The author's top five Mafia movies include Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather Trilogy, Family Enforcer, and The Sopranos.",1
"Initially, the film showed potential as a subdued character study, but it ultimately becomes predictable and uninteresting, despite having a capable cast.",0
"The film addresses the preventable birth defect of fetal alcohol syndrome and highlights the struggles of a specific family, which is representative of many families in the US and worldwide. Jimmie Smits delivers an outstanding performance in this excellent movie that conveys important messages in a graceful manner. The film's impact could be significant if more people watch it and take its message seriously.",1
"Adela is a rebellious teenager who craves attention and is sent to charm school where she meets stereotypical characters. The film attempts to convey a deeper meaning but fails, resulting in superficial interactions and unnecessary nudity. The sudden change in Adela's behavior is unrealistic, making the film unappealing to some viewers.",0
"Buster Keaton's debut in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy was amusing despite the illogical plot. The scene where Buster orders molasses from Fatty and ends up with his hat stuck in molasses was particularly funny. The film also includes slapstick involving flour and a sequence in a boarding school with Fatty dressed in drag. Although the plot doesn't make sense, the visuals are still entertaining and worth watching for Keaton fans.",1
"The Sunbow cartoons of the 80s, including GI Joe, were well-written and had well-developed characters, despite being toy commercials. However, the 2000s movie Valor vs. Venom had average animation and lacked character development. The concept of turning soldiers into mutants had been overdone in the Joe universe, but the creators tried to please fans with martial arts action. While some may enjoy VvV, it cannot compare to the glory days of GI Joe.",0
"The movie exceeded my expectations with its action, intrigue, and various locations. Although Mark Wahlberg isn't quite convincing as a leader, he plays a credible manager. The Mini Cooper is portrayed as the superhero of the film, possessing the necessary speed, dexterity, and strength to handle any task and even a reckless driver like Charlize Theron's character.",1
"Although I have enjoyed silent films about the Russian Revolution like POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD, I did not like this one due to the director's annoying and ""artsy"" shooting style. The editing was choppy and amateurish, and the use of zombies to illustrate the oppression of Ukrainian peasants was over-the-top. This movie prioritizes style over substance and is only for those who enjoy or can overlook the director's indulgence. The DVD is somewhat improved with the audio commentary, which makes the movie easier to follow and provides some interesting insights.",0
"John Hughes successfully expanded his comedic repertoire by teaming up with John Candy in the film ""Uncle Buck."" The movie follows the story of a carefree adult who becomes a better person after babysitting his brother's children. While the film was a hit with audiences, it heavily relied on Candy's charm and had repetitive gags. The children were portrayed as sitcom-smart, the other adults were unremarkable, and Amy Madigan's performance as Uncle Buck's girlfriend was too intense. The film later became a TV series, which was fitting as the material was already perfected for television.",0
"An American paleontologist, Donald Sutherland, picks up a hitchhiker in England and later returns his address book to the man's home, only to find out he has been hanged for murder. Sutherland tracks down the real murderer out of guilt. Agatha Christie's mysteries involve diverse suspects with motives and a strict timeline. The movie adaptation of ""Ordeal by Innocence"" lacks coherence, with disjointed scraps of information and confusing voiceovers. The script is slapdash, and the musical score is irritating. The movie is dull and lacks the clarity of Christie's mysteries.",0
"Despite watching the film alone, I still felt embarrassed. The reviews and camera stills on the cover led me to believe it was a documentary, but the actors were unconvincing and the story was repetitive. The Italian Australian gang's supposed training did not make them believable as they fought other gangs. The jail scene was unimpressive and the movie is not worth watching.",0
"This is the most authentic World War II movie I've seen, with German and Russian soldiers speaking their respective languages and realistic sets. The acting is exceptional and there is no Hollywood-style sentimentality or love story. Stalingrad was a brutal battle and the movie accurately portrays this without any romantic scenes. It is a thrilling and bone-chilling movie with a powerful, tragic ending.",1
"The author rented a film called NAKED ALIBI from a mail order video company and disliked it. The script lacked coherence and characters' personalities changed without reason. The protagonist, Conroy, seemed like a loose cannon and was convinced from the start that the suspect, Willis, had a criminal past. The film left a bad taste in the author's mouth despite the good cast.",0
"The science fiction in the movie Code 46 is poorly executed, with unrealistic concepts such as an empathy virus that grants instant skills and a future where cloning is common but breeding with close genetic relatives is illegal. The dialogue is slow and unnatural, and the central concept of banning sex with oneself contradicts the idea of an ecological disaster reducing living space. The only redeeming quality is the cinematography.",0
"If I had known what the film was like, I would have left the theater. Despite interesting visuals and subject matter, the film is dull and heavy-handed. The characters are stereotypical and do not develop, and the director's approach is didactic. It is a pretentious film.",0
"The film is a feminist tract that promotes harmful values and ideals, including the belief that wild animals attack instead of being tamed by singing, homosexuality is immoral, few women are bisexual, divorce is worse than infidelity, land is for human use, mothers of adult sons have the same responsibility to keep in touch as their sons, single mothers are a tragedy for their children, idolizing a parent for worthwhile ideals is healthy, and sexual behavior should only occur within marriage. The writing is inconsistent and nonsensical, with legal assumptions that are unrealistic and a portrayal of women as equally drawn to men and women that is absurd. The film is propaganda that preaches false messages and promotes a disdain for traditional heroics and the importance of fathers in raising children.",0
"Dirty Dancing is the ultimate chick-flick with hot chemistry, sexy dance routines, and beautiful songs like ""The Time of My Life"" and ""She's Like The Wind."" Patrick Swayze's singing and dancing are amazing, and his chemistry with Jennifer Grey is fantastic. Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights is also great, but it's not the same without Swayze. A third movie would be great to see what happens with Johnny's character. Billy Zane was rumored to be considered for the role, but he couldn't dance.",1
"The Ealing Comedies are a sub-genre of film that reflect British life in the late 1940s and early 1950s. While they are amusing, they are not necessarily laugh-out-loud funny, but rather breezy and good-humoured with occasional dark streaks. The Lavender Hill Mob is considered perfunctory and underdeveloped, with contrived plot devices and frustratingly factitious accidents. The movie lacks character development and logical plot progression, making it a missed opportunity by Ealing standards.",0
"The movie is a terrible B Western and a huge non-sequitur. The plot is not cohesive and the bad guy, known as The Shadow, has various evil schemes that are never fully explained. He communicates with his gang through a fake wall-safe and has a hidden panel in the main room. The good guys wear white head-bands instead of hats. The ending is weird, with a jump into the future showing Wayne and his wife with their young son dressed in Injun garb. Despite this movie, Wayne became a screen legend.",0
"The final episode of the Goldenboy OVA series takes place in an animation studio where Kentaro works. It is less risqué than previous episodes and includes a reunion with characters from earlier episodes. The only complaint is that it is too short, but it ends well. The entire series can be purchased for $17 and watched in 2 1/2 hours or individual episodes can be watched in 20 minutes. It is a good series worth checking out.",1
"Galaxina is a bad movie that is not funny, which is unusual for bad movies that often have unintentional humor. The intentional jokes fail for various reasons, and the unintentional humor also falls flat, making it a unique and supremely bad movie.",0
"Despite the promising cast and decent IMDb rating, the film I watched on Saturday night was terrible. The characters were poorly developed, the story was silly, and the portrayal of a Princeton professor was incredibly stupid. Upon investigating the positive reviews, I discovered that most were likely written by friends or hired promoters. I gave the film a rating of three.",0
"Promised Land was a remarkable show with a great cast and crew, including Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis. The plot, which follows McRaney's decision to leave everything behind after returning from Vietnam, is relatable to many veterans. The show offers valuable lessons and insight into the life of a veteran, making it one of the most poignant TV series of our time. It is a mystery why the program only ran for three years.",1
"The film is amusing and enjoyable, with a simple plot about a housewife who forgets witnessing her husband's murder and becomes obsessed with a soap opera character. However, the film lacks a clear message or theme, with short scenes that could have been developed further. The ending feels disconnected from the rest of the film. The film could have been sharper if it focused on one or two subjects. Overall, the film is entertaining but could have been more impactful.",1
"If you haven't read the book, watch the movie (6/10) for its impressive CGI, acting, and fantasy story. However, if you're a fan of the book, don't expect much as the movie's story is vastly different. The movie's setting, magic system, and character relationships differ from the book, and some explanations from the book are missing in the movie. The book's explanation of effortless work during the day and normal work at night and the reason why only a few ""Gesellen"" confront the master are not included in the movie.",0
"The movie had a promising start but ultimately disappointed me. The director tried too hard to be weird and original, resulting in too many flashbacks and bad effects. Despite my love for Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes, they could have done better. The film was promising at first, but dragged in the middle and failed to match the genius of Stanley Kubrick's controversial and original films.",0
"The film has a poorly titled name that does not relate to the plot or characters, which can lead to its failure. However, the intercontinental story about a personal ad bride, her rich husband, a theft, an identity switch, and obsessive love is well-developed and influenced by Hitchcock. The focus on the relationship between the two main characters is both a strength and weakness of the film, as it provides an interesting study but also bogs down the plot. The director's attempt to make Deneuve seem spontaneous falls flat, and the script could have been better developed to make the film tighter and more successful. Despite its flaws, the film remains interesting.",1
This film is one of the best I've ever seen and personally connected with it. I strongly identified with the Holly Hunter character and found the ending to be very sad. It was also a big break for Holly Hunter.,1
"The film ""Autumn Spring"" starts slowly but allows time to appreciate the characters' everyday life before building to a climactic segment. The director, Vladimír Michálek, adds humor to the insightful script by Jirí Hubac. The film teaches lessons about growing old together and not taking parents for granted. It encourages viewers to live life to the fullest and is a foreign gem worth watching.",1
"The film seen at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco was repetitive and unenlightening, with only 20 minutes of engaging content in its 75-minute runtime. The interviews were mostly unemotional and lacked context, making it feel like a ""how to"" guide for something that cannot be done anymore. Despite being alive during the era, the film did not evoke nostalgia or connection.",0
"Despite some dull moments and a personal desire for a different ending, this movie has stayed with me for over a decade and I highly recommend it. The acting is superb and the cast and director bring the script to life. It's a unique film that requires patience and an open mind. It's not for those seeking humor or action.",1
"Peter Lorre delivers a sinister performance as the owner of a place. A new government agent is sent to investigate Lorre's character, but when the agent's contact is killed by one of Lorre's agents, the agent is wrongly imprisoned. Lorre then brings the agent to his island to mine diamonds and extract information. The plot is somewhat confusing, but the film is still engaging, largely due to Lorre's unsettling presence. It's recommended for viewing if you come across it.",1
"This action movie is terrible for 10 reasons: amateur directing, bad acting, silly dialogue, plot holes, bad photography, bad lead actress, unreliable action scenes, poor acting by Snipes, outrageous accents, and implausible facts. It's not worth watching and not entertaining.",0
"The quality of Spike's show is questionable, with mediocre sketches and Spike's attempts at humor falling flat. It is suspected that the show's positive reviews may have been paid for. However, the show's popularity may be due to the interesting guests that Spike invites on the show.",0
"As a physicist, I found the presentation on blackholes and cosmology too slow and lacking in information for the interested layman. Those curious about the subject should check out books from the library for more detailed and wonder-inspiring explanations. Hawking is not considered the ""greatest mind"" or the world's ""smartest person"" as commonly asserted, and while he is a great scientist, others have done even more. The movie may be boring for those not truly into science.",0
"The German film ""Anatomy"" is a unique attempt at creating a horror movie, which is a departure from the usual drama or comedy genres. The story is fresh and disturbing, with Franka Potente delivering an excellent performance. The film features a talented cast and is a must-watch. It is challenging to identify the murderer, but it adds to the movie's appeal.",1
"This movie is a result of people seeing films like Blair Witch Project and thinking they can easily make a similar one with a bad script and untalented actors. The plot involves a half-human, half-animal breed in Africa that hunts and kills humans, but the movie is terrible and receives a 1 out of 10 rating. There is nothing positive to say about it.",0
"Clint Eastwood plays an injured Union Army corporal during the Civil War who is taken in by a southern school for girls until he recovers from his wounds. The young women are reluctant to turn him in to the local rebel soldiers, resulting in humorous, shocking, erotic, or even grotesque situations. Eastwood's character is amoral, conniving, and lustful, using flattery and his rugged good looks to reel in the sexually attracted women. The film did poorly in its theatrical release, but is highly recommended.",1
"Mario Van Peebles attempts to follow in Jean-Claude Van Damme's footsteps by playing a rogue robotic soldier who goes against the government, but the plot is simplistic and uninteresting. Van Peebles protects villagers and defeats an improved version of himself, but the movie lacks action and is incredibly dull. It is a poor film that resembles a more competent version of R.O.T.O.R, but still fails to make sense in its narrative and has weak villains. Overall, Solo is a disappointing and weak film.",0
The movie is a propaganda film for Australians during wartime and is not a serious retelling of Tobruk. The first half is dry and the battle scenes are low budget and almost completely black. It is recommended to use fast forward while watching. The movie is a period piece and does not hold up well today.,0
"Despite positive reviews, the movie was disappointing and lacked authenticity. The acting was subpar and amateurish, with the exception of Mary McDonnell. Even respected actress Vanessa Redgrave appeared drugged in her role. The reviewer advises others to avoid wasting their time on this film.",0
"The movie, based on Homer's tale of Odysseus, was enjoyable and humorous. Although some parts were silly, it was a great adventure with well-known actors. It was preferred over a modernized Romeo and Juliet adaptation.",1
"This movie is a classic example of being so bad that it's funny. The acting is terrible, there are no scary moments, and the camera work is amateurish. The blood looks like cherry Koolaid, the bones are obviously fake, and the witch's mask is cheap. It's hard to believe that anyone involved in making this movie didn't realize how bad it was. The credits likely contain fake names because having this movie on your resume would be career suicide. It's recommended to watch Ebert's colonoscopy video instead.",0
"The writer cannot understand why people like the movie and finds it lacking in excitement, intelligence, and character development. They are disappointed by the story and the portrayal of Nazis and the ""Basterds."" The only redeeming aspect is Christoph Waltz's performance. The writer is surprised to see the movie ranked so highly.",0
"There may be multiple versions of this documentary, but the one I watched focused on Joe's erotic films and briefly mentioned his horror films. It includes X-rated films and the infamous ""snuff"" scene from EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA. Joe is interviewed and discusses his interest in shocking audiences, mixing erotica with horror, and his relationship with Laura Gemser. He is remembered as a significant figure in Continental cinema. Rest in peace, Joe.",1
"Bette Midler delivers an outstanding performance as Mama Rose in the best filmed version of Gypsy. Her singing is magnificent, particularly in ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" and ""Rose's Turn"". The other actors, including Christine Ebersoll and Peter Riegert, also give fine performances. The direction is excellent, with no false notes or gaffes. This film is a vast improvement over the 1962 version and ranks among the top three Mama Rose performances alongside Ethel Merman and Angela Lansbury. It is highly recommended.",1
"I watched ""Night of the Demons 2"" before the first one, which was not available at my Blockbuster. Despite its flaws, the movie has everything a horror fan could want, including stereotypical characters, a haunted house, bad acting, and nudity. It's enjoyable in its own way and deserves an 8/10 rating.",1
"The production impressed me on all levels, including plot and character development. It falls under the ""realism"" genre and doesn't manipulate the audience's emotions. The actors, especially the children, are great and have amazing chemistry. It's a visually stunning movie that you won't want to end.",1
"Despite the overwhelming praise from viewers, I find myself in the minority as I do not understand the appeal of this movie. While the period setting and acting are commendable, the endless and mundane conversations at the dinner table make for a tedious and uneventful viewing experience. I cannot comprehend why this movie is so popular and would recommend watching a good mystery instead.",0
"The movie ""The Untold"" is a disappointment despite having an interesting premise and Lance Henriksen in the cast. The production quality is poor, with bad editing and cringe-worthy acting. The movie takes cues from other genres but fails to deliver. It claims to be based on true events, but the only truth is how bad it is. The reviewer strongly advises against watching it and gives it a rating of 1 out of 10.",0
"This movie is possibly the worst ever made, with a terrible plot, acting, and special effects. It is recommended to avoid watching it, and the only way to find enjoyment is to destroy the tape to prevent it from being seen by anyone else.",0
"The movie is terrible with no plot, bad acting, unfunny scenes, and stupid dialogue. It is the worst movie the person has seen and is worse than Halloween III, which they also gave 0 stars. They give it a 0 out of 10 or 1 on some platforms.",0
"The movie has a weak plot and poor acting, with Val Kilmer in a minor role as a gang leader. It is tedious to watch. The story follows a professor-like character exploring a subterranean area of Moscow with a tragic history. His friend hires Russian guides to find him, and the movie is based on this plot with repeated footage of the underground and camera effects similar to ""Day Watch"" and ""Night Watch.""",0
"The remake of Hitchcock's Psycho is a terrible film with poor acting and a lack of depth and nuance. It highlights how accomplished and brilliant Hitchcock was and has a creeping insensitivity that the original did not have. The original had moments of pathos, irony, and humor that the remake lacks. The remake is an idiotic exercise that should not have been released.",0
"The film ""Miner's Massacre"" follows three couples who search for gold in an abandoned ghost town, but the plot lacks suspense and scares. The title is misleading as only a small portion of the film takes place in the mine. The characters are uninteresting and their actions are foolish. The film receives a rating of 3/10.",0
"This suspenseful movie about the true story of Martha Moxley's murder is highly recommended for fans of detective and police shows. Christopher Meloni delivers an amazing performance, and the plot will keep you guessing until the end.",1
"This movie provides evidence of the harm that an unchecked government can inflict on unpopular individuals. It is worth watching, especially if you have read about the Patriot Act and its impact. The FBI and Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms are portrayed as unbalanced zealots who should be feared. The government has a duty to protect people's rights, but this movie shows that it has not always fulfilled that duty.",1
"I didn't enjoy the family movie with child actors, finding it cliché and predictable. Despite some cute moments with owls and a funny scene with a painted police car, I found it boring and almost fell asleep. However, I think my child will enjoy it in the future.",0
"As a new fan of the League, having only seen a few episodes on BBC Two, I found the film hilarious. The characters, including Herr Lipp, Briss, and Geoff, were great on the big screen, with the League taking full advantage of the visual medium. Geoff was the funniest character, with great one-liners and behavior. The film had a Pythonesque feel and was reminiscent of ""Life of Brian."" The appearance of Tubbs and Edward was welcome, but Papa Lazarou's line ""Hello Daves"" was the funniest. The film had a poignant ending, and I hope it's not the last on-screen Vasey venture. Even if you've never seen the League, you'll still love it, but be warned, it's a local film for local people. Overall, I loved it and would see it again. 4/5 stars.",1
"David Suchet delivered an exceptional performance as a perfectionist in all aspects, including his meticulous attention to detail and impeccable manners. Megan Dodds also impressed as a seductive woman who managed to keep crucial information from Poirot. The film is highly recommended for fans of Suchet's portrayal of the iconic detective. The stunning autumn scenery in the English countryside adds to the overall enjoyment of the movie.",1
"As a young Texan, I enjoyed a movie directed by Jacques Tourneur and starring Jean Peters, Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, and Herbert Marshall. I wrote to Peters expressing my admiration and received an autographed photo. Peters also appeared in ""Viva Zapata"" and ""Captain from Castile."" I am currently searching for a place to purchase the movie but have not been successful.",1
"Lucille Ball was a successful TV star in the 1950s and 1960s, but her movie career declined in the 1970s. She chose to star in the 1966 musical MAME, which was based on a popular novel and featured great music and a talented supporting cast. However, the film was a disaster, with bad direction, filming, and performances, including Ball's inability to dance or sing. The supporting cast also struggled, and the film is not recommended.",0
"Van Damme's latest film, set in Mexico, features impressive fight scenes and focuses on border patrol officers protecting their territory from ex-navy seals smuggling drugs into the USA. While not as good as Until Death, the film still delivers five-star action and acting. Fans of Until Death, The Hard Corps, and Second in Command will enjoy this movie.",1
"""The Slaughter Rule"" has great performances from Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall, and David Morse, but the script is poorly written and the movie is boring. The beautiful locales cannot make up for the stupid premise and throw-away lines. The reviewer suggests watching ""The Believer"" instead and gives ""The Slaughter Rule"" a score of 2 out of 10.",0
"The author has been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters for a long time, admiring their love, innocence, and camaraderie. Kermit was a role model for deep thinking and problem solving. However, the movie ""It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie"" has completely rewritten the characters to be horny, nasty, selfish, and cheesy. The portrayal of God and angels is also disappointing. The author had to stop watching and believes the movie has no redeeming content or charm. The author is disappointed that the movie departed from Jim Henson's original heart-centered, socially conscious version and believes it does a disservice to his legacy.",0
"This B-horror movie takes itself too seriously, despite its plot about an elderly woman turned into a vampire by her lodger. When the lodger dies, the woman must feed on her own, causing family problems and attracting attention from the authorities. The film lacks humor and relies on mild gore and creature makeup effects to satisfy B-movie fans. It's not the worst, but not recommended with a rating of 4.5/10.",0
"Shtrafbat is a unique Russian perspective on WWII, which has been largely ignored in Western films. While it may not have the same visual effects as Band of Brothers, the story of Russian soldiers is compelling enough to overlook this. Shtrafbat challenges myths about the war and presents the enemy as human. It highlights the brutal nature of the Eastern front and the toll it took on soldiers.",1
"I played Stan in the movie ""Dreams Come True"" and my brother, Steve Charlton, played Swenson. The acting was mostly poor with local actors from Wisconsin, but I enjoyed seeing myself on the big screen. The movie played for 2 nights in 3 theaters and featured the band Spooner, who later became Garbage.",0
"Antonioni's ""Beyond the Clouds"" is a film that will be rediscovered on tape or DVD. Despite initial disappointment with the slow pace, the film's subtle moods and humor become apparent on further viewings. The film features sex and international stars, but is unmistakably Antonioni's. It would have succeeded on the art house circuit with proper promotion, but will have to find its audience on the small screen. The author urges all film enthusiasts to see it.",1
"While channel surfing, I came across a captivating classic film featuring a rebellious female lead, which I highly recommend.",1
"This movie became a favorite after one viewing. The viewer's opinion of Prot changes throughout the film, making it thought-provoking and a must-see.",1
"The movie made me crave ice cream, but it was cheesy and poorly acted. The death of the ""Ice Cream King"" was comical, and the bars on the ice cream truck window were unnecessary. Skip the movie and go to Dairy Queen for ice cream instead.",0
"Robert Montgomery and Robert Young play young submarine officers stationed in Italy during World War I, with entertaining dialog and a hilarious performance by Jimmy Durante as the ship's cook. Walter Huston's character is an inspiring captain, and the technology displayed in the battle scenes is surprisingly similar to that of World War II. The movie portrays basic human nature as similar to modern times and challenges the idea of a conservative past. Overall, the cast, characters, action scenes, and historical depiction are excellent.",1
"This movie lacks big-budget special effects and action scenes, but offers a realistic portrayal of imperfect characters who learn to accept differences and find order in chaos. The cast of quirky characters, including Kiefer Sutherland and Henry Czerny, deliver excellent and believable performances. The film is worth watching for the characters alone.",1
"This horror film is visually stunning and uses inventive twists on vampire mythology. The characters are interesting and quirky, and the film never feels exploitative. The plot jumps around, forcing the viewer to engage with the story. The vampires have superhuman strength and there are moments of magical romance, but the love affair becomes increasingly disturbing. The acting, particularly by OK-vin Kim, is superb. This film is a must-see for fans of Oldboy and those who appreciate art in horror.",1
"The Jurassic Park movies are among my favorites, but the game based on the movie for Super Nintendo is terrible. The gameplay is inconsistent and the sound and controllers are poor. It's a waste of time and money and should be avoided.",0
"The movie is gripping and reminiscent of 70's MGM crime movies. The cast, editing, and acting are excellent, keeping the pace rapid. It is one of the better crime movies of the decade, and the director and cast deserve praise.",1
"Jeffrey Combs is a horror legend and the movie he stars in is enjoyable and humorous. Although Combs' performance is impressive, more dialogue would have been appreciated. Beyond Re-Animator is highly anticipated.",1
"This is a terrible action movie for several reasons. Seagal is out of shape and his fight scenes require editing or replacement. The villain is weak and the action scenes are poorly executed with low body count. There are no good lines or jokes, and the psychological interlude is ridiculous. The movie includes typical action elements like helicopters, slow motion, and weapons, but it is still a painful experience. It was written and directed by Don Michael Paul.",0
"The movie is based on the true story of Lucille Fray, an Iowa housewife who got breast cancer after having her 10th child. She spent her last year finding new homes for her children to prevent the state from taking them away from her alcoholic husband. The script is still great 20 years after it was made. Barbara Stanwyck won an Emmy for best actress, but she praised Ann-Margret's performance during her acceptance speech. The grown children were reunited on ""That's Incredible"" before the film aired in 1983.",1
"""Pitch Black"" exceeded expectations, offering excitement and entertainment. While it borrows from other films like ""Alien"" and ""Predator,"" it still manages to be a great rip-off. The story follows a group of people who crash land on a planet with dangerous aliens that thrive in darkness during a solar eclipse. The protagonist, Riddick, has the rare ability to see in the dark. The film is not meant to be original or believable, but it succeeds in entertaining the audience. The aliens are a mix of creatures from other films, but they work well in this context. ""Pitch Black"" is better than the second and third ""Alien"" films combined and stands out as a new series. Two more sequels are planned.",1
"Garden State is a mediocre film with a disjointed plot and pointless, quirky scenes. The main character is unlikable and the message of the film is unclear. It jumps between genres and lacks cohesion. Despite being Zach Braff's first feature film as director, writer, and lead actor, it could have been better. Braff is a talented performer, but his second attempt may be more successful if he focuses on one role.",0
"Initially compared to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, Existenz is not an action movie and is about the human tendency to replace reality with an artificial world of make-believe. The most chilling moment is when the characters surrender their free will to participate in a story. Living ""in the game"" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth. Upon repeated viewings, the movie's depth becomes apparent and it deserves another viewing.",1
"""The Adventures of Sebastian Cole"" did not meet expectations despite an interesting preview. Adrian Grenier's performance was the only redeeming quality. The low budget was a nice touch, but the script lacked coherence and the dialogue was weak. While the main idea was okay, irrelevant scenes were added. The film had potential, but ultimately fell short. It may be worth watching for Grenier's strong lead, but otherwise, it is not recommended.",0
"""Robin Hood: Men in Tights is a must-see comedy, especially for fans of Cary Elwes who delivers a great performance as Robin of Locksley. While some scenes may not be as funny, overall the cast is fantastic and there are many laugh-out-loud moments. It's also interesting to note that Elwes and Patrick Stewart previously worked together in ""Lady Jane"" and seeing them reunited on screen is a treat. Highly recommended for a good laugh.""",1
"The screenplay is excellent and keeps the audience engaged, proving that a movie can survive without a complex story. The plot is simple but the performances by Vijay and Prakashraj are brilliant. The Tamil version is faster-paced than the Telugu version and the movie stays on track without any deviation. The characters' backgrounds are well-understood.",1
"In 1910 Paris, a retired opera singer leaves her fortune to her cat Duchess and her kittens. However, the butler Edgar kidnaps them and abandons them in the countryside. With the help of a streetwise tomcat named Thomas O'Malley, they try to foil Edgar's plans. The post-Walt Disney animated movie features jazzy tunes, good voice acting, and impressive animation for its time. It is a cult favorite and highly recommended.",1
"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce reprise their roles as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in the second Universal series film. Holmes uses various disguises to protect a physicist from the Nazis and his nemesis, Professor Moriarty, who wants to sell the scientist's bomb sight plans to the Nazis. Lionel Atwill plays Moriarty in this entry, adding to the film's appeal. The banter between Holmes and Moriarty is always entertaining.",1
"Despite lacking a coherent storyline and evidence of rewrites during production, the film is impressive due to Michelle Pfeiffer's exceptional portrayal of Catwoman and the memorable performances of Christopher Walken and Danny DeVito. Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman is also underrated. The film's music and style are thrilling, but the third act falls short. The chemistry between Pfeiffer and Keaton was classic and could have continued in a trilogy, but the opportunity was lost due to the film's dark themes.",1
"The movie ""The Giant Claw"" features a ridiculous extraterrestrial bird that is so silly it's almost like a cartoon. The film lacks a decent climax and is not as good as other sci-fi classics like ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers."" Despite its flaws, the bird is so memorable that it's worth watching for a good laugh.",0
"The movie is dull and lacks color. It begins with an explanation of cryogenics and protests outside a lab. A bank robbery occurs, and one of the robbers' fathers arranges for his son to be frozen. A power outage causes the frozen people to become zombies with silver suits and green wrinkled skin. Linda Blair appears occasionally but has a small role. The movie ends with text captions that are silly.",0
I enjoyed watching this movie on HBO and was completely absorbed by it. The director did a great job and Norman Reedus gave a cool performance. The movie had unexpected twists and a satisfying ending. The opening scenes with massive images were hard on the eyes. I wondered why the scene of Norman Reedus changing currency notes was not shown.,1
"The Falcon and the Snowman is a true story about two wealthy college students from Los Angeles who become Soviet spies. One is a drug smuggler and the other works at an aerospace firm where he learns about CIA tactics. Set in the early 70s, the Hutton character is appalled and convinces his friend to betray their country. The movie is not a fast-paced thriller, but still worth renting.",1
"Luther the Geek (1990) is a terrible horror movie about a man who bites off chicken heads and thinks he's a chicken. After being released from prison, he kills people and tortures a family. The movie has bad acting and a laughable ending, and lacks gore. It receives a 3/10 rating.",0
"The negative reviews of this film focus on its historical accuracy, but the author believes artistic license should be allowed. However, the director's attempt at a screwball comedy falls short due to slow pacing, obnoxious mugging, and lack of chemistry between the leads. The movie is not funny and the author only got one good laugh. The author advises to avoid this film.",0
"Christine Lahti and Mary Tyler Moore were successful in their roles in the soap-like story, while Ted Danson's character was unpleasant and caused two women to pine for him. The story revolves around the friendship between the two women, one married and the other aware of her biological clock. Danson's character behaved poorly and it would have been more interesting if he had not been killed off, allowing the women to wise up and leave him. The friendship between the women was tainted by their shared experience of having a terrible husband.",1
"The movie explores the world of wine and its connection to people and society. Despite having no particular interest in wine, the author found the film enlightening and appreciated the director's ability to show people as they are without taking a stand. The movie highlights the benefits and costs of the wine industry and features older, disillusioned wine makers as its real stars. Although the camera work may take some getting used to, the movie is highly recommended.",1
"Comparisons to the original series are inevitable, and it's unfortunate that Diana Rigg left due to mistreatment by producers. Linda Thorson was an adequate replacement, but lacked chemistry with MacNee. The New Avengers should have been left alone due to declining quality and forced humor. Reviving old shows in new formats or movies is a difficult task.",0
"The 1944 musical, directed by Charles Vidor, features young stars and veteran actors such as Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The film follows the story of Rusty Parker, a dancer at Danny McGuire's night club in Brooklyn, who becomes a top model for a cover girl magazine. The film's theme music is ""Long Ago & Far Away"" by Jerome Kern. The film was a big hit at the box office during WW II and was nominated for many awards. It launched the careers of Hayworth and Kelly. This classic film is a must-see.",1
"Bonjour, Monsieur Sholmi is a delightful Israeli film about a dysfunctional Moroccan Jewish family, seen through the eyes of their 16-year-old son. The entire cast is magnificent and the movie has won 8 international awards. Despite its limited run in the USA, it is worth renting. It has received a rating of ***1/2 (out of 4) and 95 points (out of 100) on IMDb.",1
"The commenter warns against the high user rating of the film and lists several reasons why they did not enjoy it, including incoherent characters, absurd casting, and unnecessary violence. They also suggest that the film may promote incestuous relationships and compare it to Japanese pornography. Overall, they do not recommend the film for entertainment or thought-provoking purposes.",0
"The film adaptation of Ruth Gordon's play, ""Over 21,"" starring Irene Dunne, depicts the challenges of keeping a marriage together during wartime. The play, which ran on Broadway in 1944, was staged by George S. Kaufman. The film version required significant script reconstruction to expand the setting beyond the bungalow. The story follows two writers, played by Dunne and Alexander Knox, and their employer, played by Charles Coburn. The film has a positive outlook on the post-war world, but unfortunately, it was not accurate in predicting the outcome of the peace conferences.",1
I love this movie so much that I've watched it countless times and would never pass up the chance to see it again. I'm eager to know the name of the resort where it was filmed and would appreciate an email if anyone knows. I first saw the movie when I was around Nikki's age and it inspired me to ask my dad to take me on a similar adventure. The setting is incredible and the puppy-love story is adorable. It's a must-have for any DVD collection.,1
"I Sell the Dead is a horror comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously, with funny, scary, and gory bits throughout. The story follows grave robber Arthur Blake, who confesses to various crimes while being bribed with Irish Whisky by a Catholic priest. The film is a horror anthology of disjointed tales linked by a similar cast and theme. However, it falls short in comparison to Trick 'r Treat, which tells a more unified story. The film also plays fast and loose with history, which detracts from the fantasy. Overall, it's a funny horror film worth renting, but it could have been better.",1
"I vaguely recall a movie filmed at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah, a place I enjoyed visiting in my youth. The owner/manager of the hostel appeared in the film, which featured jeeps and nudity, but was more notable for its scenic rock formations than its soft-core porn. I am unsure if the movie is available on tape or DVD.",0
"The Crash Cinema DVD release is poorly done, with bad mastering and audio synchronization issues. It's not worth buying. The VHS version looks better but is missing several minutes of the film. The original camera negative is missing.",0
"After seven months of searching, I finally found a rentable DVD copy of Cassavetes' first feature, Shadows, which was shot on a shoestring budget in Manhattan and in his acting workshop. The mostly amateur actors developed bonds with each other and invented their characters through months of improvisational rehearsals, resulting in daring work in Faces. The homemade production's out-of-sync dubbing and sound recording, granular cinematography, and up-close camera setups build an immersive atmosphere that suits Cassavetes' nuanced vision of human relationships. Charles Mingus's largely improvised jazz score complements the film's vision of living in the moment.",1
"This film is good but different from Seagal's usual movies, which may disappoint some fans. It's not solely focused on Seagal's character and his actions are unique. The concept of him being an intellectual is refreshing. Although there are unrealistic parts, the film is enjoyable. If you're looking for a classic Seagal action film, you may be disappointed, but it's still worth watching. It's some of his best work in a while.",1
"Catherine Breillat's film ""Sex Is Comedy"" was selected for the Quinzaine des réalisateurs in 2002. The film is a comedy of actors' manners and explores the genres of Making-Of, film within a film, pornography, and exhibitionism. Breillat uses visual codes and a clinical analysis of sexuality to break and analyze taboos. The film features actors Grégoire Colin and Roxanne Mesquida, whom Breillat invents and observes to lead them to give their feelings, body, and soul. Breillat's art is that of a researcher, pushing the limits of intimate scenes and revealing the loving imitation power of actors in a landscape of formidable and dramatic humanity.",1
"I regret watching this movie, as it was worse than expected. Ashton Kutcher's performance was a mistake, and the plot involves babysitting an owl with ridiculous rules. The film is frustrating and predictable, with bad things happening that are not entertaining. Tara Reid's performance was good, but the movie likely hurt her career. The ending is happy, but expected. Don't watch it, as you will regret it.",0
"Despite watching the movie in French, with potential loss in translation and accents, it was a great and uplifting film that accurately depicted the complexities of individual sexuality, gender roles, and finding one's place in their community. The portrayal of the gay community was positive and honest, and while the ending may have been slightly disappointing, it reflects real life. Overall, it's a great movie to watch alone or with a date.",1
"By chance, I watched a film on TV very early one morning. Although the subject has been covered before and the ending was predictable, I enjoyed it because of the acting. Sam Neil was good but could have played his part with ease. Some of the acting was bad and some of the symbolism was heavy-handed. However, two actors, Sinéad Cusack and Matthew Newton, impressed me a lot, especially Newton who was very convincing and deserves more recognition.",1
"This film is a masterpiece that has been overlooked by many. The characters, dialogue, and themes are exceptional, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to more from Matthew George.",1
The film adaptation of the book is terrible due to poor casting and unnecessary additions to the original script. It is reminiscent of other expensive yet unimpressive films. The filmmakers should be banned from making movies for 10 years and the film is an insult to real filmmakers. It would be Exhibit A in a trial against Hollywood's incompetence.,0
A couple in Chicago is falsely accused of killing their daughter and face public scrutiny and a trial. They are represented by lawyers who give them bad advice and are charged with fabricated evidence. The film focuses on their suffering and the function of gossip in regulating private lives. The movie is aimed at wrenching tears from the audience and lacks insight into human nature.,0
"I rented a movie with low expectations, but it turned out to be the best Brazilian film I've seen. The story is unique and centers around Antonio, who loves his small town, while his love interest, Karina, wants to see the world. To prove his love, Antonio decides to bring the world to her by putting Nordestina on the map. The film is enjoyable and uplifting, although some may find the editing style a bit theatrical.",1
"As a child, I watched ""Challenge to be Free"" and owned it on VHS. Recently, I re-watched it and found the story to be just as powerful. The movie instills values such as self-reliance, freedom, and love of nature. Despite being a ""B"" movie, it is memorable, especially if watched as a child.",1
"The movie with the ""underdog finally succeeds"" sport theme is successful, but the film is pointless and boring. The characters are unlikable, and there is no conflict or tension. The depiction of running is absurd, and the big race is unrealistic. The movie has no resolution and is not worth watching.",0
"The film is a great discovery, featuring a young girl who meets an older couple on a road trip to Florida. The cast is perfectly suited for their roles, with newcomer Emily Grace delivering a fantastic performance. The lighting, photography, and editing are all well done, creating a realistic feel of traveling on the highway. The reviewer highly recommends seeing the film.",1
"Despite being open-minded about movies, Lil Pimp was a disappointment. It was poorly written and had too much inappropriate content to be a children's movie, but was too cheesy to be an adult movie. The humor was not funny and the plot made no sense. Even the involvement of well-known actors like Bernie Mac and Ludacris could not save it. The writers must not have put much effort into it.",0
"This movie is a beautiful portrayal of faith and loyalty, set in the romantic English countryside. It is a great role model for young girls and was a favorite of the author's daughter. The story follows Velvet, a girl whose life revolves around her horse, Pi, and her pursuit of her dream. Elizabeth Taylor's natural acting and Mickey Rooney's performance as Mi are outstanding, and Anne Revere won an Academy Award for her role as Velvet's mother. This classic from Hollywood's golden age is sweet and inspiring and highly recommended.",1
"The story follows Leonard, an up-and-coming inventor, whose plans are derailed by his romantic involvement with a wealthy woman named Carol. The film features a young Humphrey Bogart before he developed his signature style, and includes strong performances from supporting characters. While the film contains some adult themes, it is relatively tame compared to modern television. Directed by Thornton Freeland, who would go on to direct ""Flying Down to Rio"" the following year.",1
"The beginning of the movie was copied from ""Eight-legged Freaks"", but the rest of the film is dull and unimpressive. A drifter returns to his hometown and reunites with old acquaintances, including a troublesome child, a single mother, and a loud local. The special effects are poor, and the alien ship and atmospheric disturbances are reminiscent of ""Close Encounters"". The acting, story, camera angles, and editing are all subpar. It is not recommended to rent or watch unless you have a lot of beer and company.",0
"""The Duke Is Tops"" is a ""race movie"" from the time of segregation that is notable for being the film debut of Lena Horne, who plays a singer named Ethel Andrews. The plot follows Ethel as she leaves her producer mentor Duke Davis to pursue a career in the big time, while Duke teams up with Doc Dorando for a series of medicine shows. Eventually, Duke offers his services as producer and band leader to bring his lineup of specialty acts for his chance at the big time with Ethel next to him. Despite the familiar plot, the film is fascinating due to its intended audience and features appearances by several supporting players, including Joel Fluellen and Marie Bryant from Louisiana.",1
"cribes.

The film is highly energetic and entertaining, and as a film student at NYU, I commend Jim Cox for his excellent sense of style and pace. I believe he will make a name for himself in the film industry, and I hope this short film will receive wider distribution.",1
"The writer is surprised that ""Shades"" from That Thing You Do accepted the role in this movie, and believes that even Cory Feldman wouldn't have taken it. They strongly advise against watching it and suggest watching the top 250 movies instead. The writer regrets renting it and urges others to stay away.",0
"The movie has great acting by Ryan Reynolds and a good soundtrack, but is flawed with a boring second half, an annoying character, and a poor explanation of the numbers. It has potential but is only recommended for fans of Reynolds or those with extra time.",0
"The film lacks interesting characters and a threatening menace, making it drag on without anything unexpected happening. It is one of the weakest adaptations of a Stephen King story.",0
"""The Love Light"" is a silent film that serves as a reminder for the aristocracy to appreciate their privileges compared to the harsh life of common people. The film, directed by Dame Frances Marion, tells the story of Dame Angela Carlotti, an Italian girl who falls in love with a German spy during war. Despite the lack of emotion and rhythm in the film, Dame Mary Pickford's performance is the only interesting aspect. The film ends with Dame Angela starting a new life with her blind lover in a poor Italian village.",0
"The first cartoon with sound is 'Steamboat Willie', featuring Mickey Mouse making music with farm animals on a steamboat, and is considered a clever and humorous classic.",1
"The culture portrayed in the film stands out for its close-knit community of women who support each other through generations and overlook each other's flaws. The film also explores the culture's belief in the supernatural, which is a mix of their Catholic faith and their need to make amends with the dead. The mother's character serves as a metaphor for the city's belief in life after death.",0
"The film's main character, Ohwon, is exceptional and the message of the film is that it's difficult to achieve greatness without conforming to societal norms and systems. The film is recommended by the Korean director.",1
"Savage Guns is a low-budget spaghetti western about a man seeking revenge for his brother's murder. The film lacks creativity, humor, and engaging characters. The lead actor's performance is wooden and unappealing. The dance hall scene with a poorly sung German accent is particularly bad.",0
"Elderbush Gilch was a letdown with a weak plot and offensive Native American characters. Despite featuring Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh in pre-Birth of a Nation roles and some impressive battle scenes, it lacked the depth and intelligence of Griffith's other films. However, it still showcased Griffith's directing skills and had similarities to the climax of his superior film, Birth of a Nation.",0
"Preston Sturgis' film, THE POWER AND THE GLORY, was not seen by the public for many years until it resurfaced in the late 1990s. It gained notoriety due to Pauline Kael's suggestion that the screenplay for CITIZEN KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay. However, the two films differ in their use of narrators, with only two in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. The film tells the story of Tom Garner, a successful railroad leader, and his downfall due to his obsession with work and infidelity. While not as successful as CITIZEN KANE, the film is still of interest to movie lovers for its attempt at business realism and social commentary in Depression America.",1
"I recently watched an amazing movie that I could relate to. It brought back memories of when my sister went to college and we had to move frequently. The mother in the movie reminded me of my own. It may not be appealing to boys as it is emotional. Overall, it is one of the best realistic movies I have seen and Natalie Portman was excellent. I give it a perfect score of 10/10.",1
"After seeing Yvette McClendon in a film at the Los Angeles Film Festival, I wanted to see more of her. However, the movie I found was poorly directed and not worth watching, despite Yvette's brief appearance. I still like her and hope to find her other movies.",0
"Park Chan-Wook disregards the theory of horror that suggests keeping monsters and violence off-screen, instead showing anything he wants on-screen while relying on actors and dialogue for subtlety. He uses a variety of stylistic techniques to tell the story of a couple's relationship, linked by vampirism and priestliness. The film is comparable to Twilight but more raw and honest, depicting a dysfunctional romance with no happily ever after. The movie lacks a structured act format but provides character building and horror elements, with an effective soundtrack.",1
"I bought the film ""Chiller"" for a dollar at a department store, but it was not very good. The problem is the director, Wes Craven, who lacks the visual and storytelling skills of a great director like Hitchcock. The film looks professional, but the drama falls flat and the important moments are rushed. It feels like the work of an art student who has nothing to say. Comparing it to Spielberg's ""Duel"" shows that being made for TV is not an excuse.",0
"In 2004, the author praised ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" on an IMDb message board, calling it a fascinating character study that holds up well as a look at life in the US after WWII. The author also noted that the film still resonates with audiences and is ranked highly on IMDb and AFI. After watching it again in 2005, the author found it to still be a powerful and well-crafted movie.",1
"A friend gave me a DVD labeled ""The Savage Guns,"" but it turned out to be a different movie. The actual film is terrible, with a soundtrack that combines TV Batman, early James Bond, and spaghetti western music. The main character gallops around to fill time and give the soundtrack something to do. The English dubbing over the Italian is poorly done, but not bad enough to be campy like Ed Wood films. Overall, it's just plain awful.",0
"Rowan Atkinson's talent in creating the multi-layered and iconic character of Mr Bean, who hardly speaks, is impressive. Despite the show only running for one season, Mr Bean is recognized by many due to the effort put into the performance. The character is both exasperating and lovable, innocent yet evil. The show can be depressing at times, but also impresses with Bean's inventive methods of getting out of trouble. ""Bean"" is a family show that is enjoyable for all ages due to its intelligent slapstick humor. It is a classic that always brightens up the day.",1
"""Night of the Blood Beast,"" a 1958 sci-fi film, features America's first man in space being impregnated by alien seahorse creatures. Despite its lurid title, the film lacks scares, suspense, and thought-provoking content. It is a low-budget production with a cheap-looking monster and a musical score that does not match the on-screen events. The film raises many unanswered questions and is only recommended for 1950s sci-fi enthusiasts.""",0
"Macbeth's success may be due to its similarities to the slasher genre and its appeal as a shorter play with a focus on a compelling main character. However, despite its potential as a movie, previous adaptations have fallen short. The 2006 version attempts to modernize the story with gangsters and drugs, but ultimately fails to capture the essence of the original play. The film lacks clear motivations for the characters and reduces poignant scenes to pointlessness. Overall, the film is ultimately pointless and fails to do justice to Shakespeare's work.",0
"Despite being a fan of Ed Harris, I found Needful Things to be his worst film due to a poor script and unbelievable story. The involvement of talented actors like Harris and Von Sydow was wasted. It's unclear why the movie was made, possibly due to the commercial success of King's books or the need for low-quality VHS movies in the 90s. Regardless, it was a bad choice for everyone involved.",0
"Anna Christie reunites with her father, a boat skipper, and falls in love with Matt. However, her secret and the conflict between Matt and Chris create tension. Despite Garbo's captivating performance, the film's slow pace and incomprehensible dialogue make it dull.",0
"I own the Civil War miniseries on DVD because I love the story, costumes, and character development. The series balances good and evil, and keeps me engaged with its drama. However, I advise against watching the third movie as it is a let down compared to the first two and most original characters do not return.",1
"The French have a liking for Jerry Lewis and Edgar Allan Poe, possibly due to the ""Beaudelaire effect"". However, a trilogy of Poe's stories turned into films is not impressive. ""Toby Dammit"" is enjoyable but unrelated to Poe's story, ""Metzergenstein"" is terrible, and ""William Wilson"" is the most faithful but lacks style. It is recommended to skip ""Metzergenstein"", watch ""William Wilson"", and keep ""Toby Dammit"" on in the background if you're a Fellini fan.",0
"The movie's main theme is Joanna's life of deception, as shown by her hiding even mundane things from her husband. When she accidentally hits a child and leaves the scene, she decides to keep quiet about it, but struggles to maintain her facade. It's a great movie that I've watched multiple times.",1
The writer disliked the outdated kids' movie Time Bandits and found it embarrassing to watch with their family. They believe that children and adults would not enjoy it and compare it to other outdated movies they did not like. The writer also criticizes the overacting of the villains and advises against watching the movie.,0
"I highly suggest this movie for those seeking a peaceful, enjoyable, and stimulating experience. The lack of explicit content made it a delightful watch. The Buffalo scene was particularly enjoyable for me, but the film's message is universal. I am grateful for the opportunity to watch Manna From Heaven and recommend it to others.",1
"I loved a program and searched for it on video for years, but couldn't find it. I have the second half and am willing to share it in exchange for a copy of the first half. Some people are selling it on eBay for a high price, which is unfair and a copyright violation. Contact me at thndrmouse@aol.com.",1
"The film's message is summed up by the character who plays an aging film director pretending to be dead, stating that in Italy, the dead rule. The film portrays a country without a future, controlled by old and jaded men. The seemingly senseless story of a director filming marriage parties conveys the issues that are not working in Italy. The film's meaning may not be clear to foreigners, but it is worth seeing for Italians who live in Italy.",1
"I watched the end of the show after surviving the first hour. For better mythology, watch Armand Assante's ""The Odyssey."" Good storytelling doesn't need changes. I hope Sean Astin needed the money because this version is not good. Sorbo's version was at least humorous. Halmi's TV series was amusing, but this one lacks quality.",0
"Screenwriters Viertel, Harrison, and Parker help Hitchcock explore his favorite theme of an innocent man falsely accused of a crime and on the run. Hitchcock creates suspense in the plot about a warehouse worker blamed for his friend's death and sets out to find the real culprit. The film features exciting action and surprisingly good performances from typically unremarkable actors.",1
"Hellraiser parts 1 to 3 are great, but Bloodline is bad with a lot of gore but no meaning or originality. The movie is about the past, present, and future of the puzzle box, but the three stories don't connect well. Pinhead is in the movie, but he's a boring bad guy who talks too much and kidnaps kids and kills birds. The dog from hell is confusing and incoherent with the series, as is Pinhead's relationship with Angelique.",0
